    "The FindZebra corpus contrains a lot of different articles on rare and orphan diseases, each of which has a unique CUI linked to it. The CUI identifies which disease the article is about. The article might potentially be about more than one disease, but only one CUI is connected to it. Even though the whole article is about one disease, some parts of the article might be more relevant than others. In this notebook, every article will be split into several passages to use for both training and retrieval. Every article will be identified with a unique apid (article passage id), and every passage will be linked to the apid of the article it came from.\n",

[5] the study included women admitted to hospital for one or more days for reasons other than delivery or venous thromboembolism. peripartum cardiomyopathy other names post-partum cardiomyopathy [1] specialty obstetrics , cardiology peripartum cardiomyopathy (ppcm) is a form of dilated cardiomyopathy that is defined as a deterioration in cardiac function presenting typically between the last month of pregnancy and up to six months postpartum . as with other forms of dilated cardiomyopathy, ppcm involves systolic dysfunction of the heart with a decrease of the left ventricular ejection fraction (ef) with associated congestive heart failure and an increased risk of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias , thromboembolism (blockage of a blood vessel by a blood clot), and even sudden cardiac death .\n",

      " venous thromboembolism most commonly manifests as deep vein thrombosis, which may progress to pulmonary embolism if the clot dislodges and travels to the lung. other manifestations include thromboses of the cerebral or visceral veins and recurrent pregnancy loss (summary by seligsohn and lubetsky, 2001 and varga and kujovich, 2012). thrombotic events occurred more often in years in which the patient had been immobile for more than a week or had had surgery. there was no predisposing event such as surgery or pregnancy in 50% of all first episodes and 65% of recurrences of venous thromboembolism in the heterozygotes.\n",

      " the blockages either result from organised (or hardened) blood clots that usually originate from the deep veins of the lower limbs of the body ( thromboembolism ) and lodge in the pulmonary arterial tree after passing through the right side of the heart. the blockages may also result from scar tissue that forms at the site where the clot has damaged the endothelial lining of the pulmonary arteries, causing permanent fibrous obstruction (blood flow blockage). [18] the rcog advised in early april 2020 that because pregnancy is a hypercoagulable state and that people admitted to hospital with covid-19 are also hypercoagulable, infection with covid-19 could increase the risk of venous thromboembolism and that this risk could be compounded by reduced mobility due to self-isolating. [19] their guidelines thus advise that any pregnant woman admitted to hospital with a covid-19 infection should receive at least 10 days of prophylactic low-molecular-weight heparin after being discharged from the hospital.\n",

[2] [4] a study of more than 200,000 women came to the result that admission to inpatient care during pregnancy was associated with an 18-fold increase in the risk of venous thromboembolism (vte) during the stay, and a 6-fold increase in risk in the four weeks after discharge, compared with pregnant women who did not require hospitalization.
