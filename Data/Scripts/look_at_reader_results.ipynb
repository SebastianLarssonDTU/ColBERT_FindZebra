       "   'text': 'Cyclic vomiting syndrome is a disorder that causes recurrent episodes of nausea, vomiting, and tiredness (lethargy). This condition is diagnosed most often in young children, but it can affect people of any age.The episodes of nausea, vomiting, and lethargy last anywhere from an hour to 10 days. An affected person may vomit several times per hour, potentially leading to a dangerous loss of fluids (dehydration). Additional symptoms can include unusually pale skin (pallor), abdominal pain, diarrhea, headache, fever, and an increased sensitivity to light (photophobia) or to sound (phonophobia). In most affected people, the signs and symptoms of each attack are quite similar. These attacks can be debilitating, making it difficult for an affected person to go to work or school.Episodes of nausea, vomiting, and lethargy can occur regularly or apparently at random, or can be triggered by a variety of factors. The most common triggers are emotional excitement and infections. Other triggers can include periods without eating (fasting), temperature extremes, lack of sleep, overexertion, allergies, ingesting certain foods or alcohol, and menstruation.If the condition is not treated, episodes usually occur four to 12 times per year. Between attacks, vomiting is absent, and nausea is either absent or much reduced. However, many affected people experience other symptoms during and between episodes, including pain, lethargy, digestive disorders such as gastroesophageal reflux and irritable bowel syndrome, and fainting spells (syncope). People with cyclic vomiting syndrome are also more likely than people without the disorder to experience depression, anxiety, and panic disorder. It is unclear whether these health conditions are directly related to nausea and vomiting.Cyclic vomiting syndrome is often considered to be a variant of migraines, which are severe headaches often associated with pain, nausea, vomiting, and extreme sensitivity to light and sound. Cyclic vomiting syndrome is likely the same as or closely related to a condition called abdominal migraine, which is characterized by attacks of stomach pain and cramping. Attacks of nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain in childhood may be replaced by migraine headaches as an affected person gets older. Many people with cyclic vomiting syndrome or abdominal migraine have a family history of migraines.Most people with cyclic vomiting syndrome have normal intelligence, although some affected people have developmental delay or intellectual disability. Autism spectrum disorder, which affects communication and social interaction, have also been associated with cyclic vomiting syndrome. Additionally, muscle weakness (myopathy) and seizures are possible. People with any of these additional features are said to have cyclic vomiting syndrome plus.FrequencyThe exact prevalence of cyclic vomiting syndrome is unknown; estimates range from 4 to 2,000 per 100,000 children. The condition is diagnosed less frequently in adults, although recent studies suggest that the condition may begin in adulthood as commonly as it begins in childhood.CausesAlthough the causes of cyclic vomiting syndrome have yet to be determined, researchers have proposed several factors that may contribute to the disorder. These factors include changes in brain function, hormonal abnormalities, and gastrointestinal problems. Many researchers believe that cyclic vomiting syndrome is a migraine-like condition, which suggests that it is related to changes in signaling between nerve cells (neurons) in certain areas of the brain. Many affected individuals have abnormalities of the autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary body functions such as heart rate, blood pressure, and digestion. Based on these abnormalities, cyclic vomiting syndrome is often classified as a type of dysautonomia.Some cases of cyclic vomiting syndrome, particularly those that begin in childhood, may be related to changes in mitochondrial DNA. Mitochondria are structures within cells that convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use. Although most DNA is packaged in chromosomes within the nucleus, mitochondria also have a small amount of their own DNA (known as mitochondrial DNA or mtDNA).Several changes in mitochondrial DNA have been associated with cyclic vomiting syndrome. Some of these changes alter single DNA building blocks (nucleotides), whereas others rearrange larger segments of mitochondrial DNA. These changes likely impair the ability of mitochondria to produce energy. Researchers speculate that the impaired mitochondria may cause certain cells of the autonomic nervous system to malfunction, which could affect the digestive system. However, it remains unclear how changes in mitochondrial function could cause episodes of nausea, vomiting, and lethargy; abdominal pain; or migraines in people with this condition.Learn more about the chromosome associated with Cyclic vomiting syndromemitochondrial dnaInheritance PatternIn most cases of cyclic vomiting syndrome, affected people have no known history of the disorder in their family. However, many affected individuals have a family history of related conditions, such as migraines, irritable bowel syndrome, or depression, in their mothers and other maternal relatives. This family history suggests an inheritance pattern known as maternal inheritance or mitochondrial inheritance, which applies to genes contained in mtDNA. Because egg cells, but not sperm cells, contribute mitochondria to the developing embryo, children can only inherit disorders resulting from mtDNA mutations from their mother. These disorders can appear in every generation of a family and can affect both males and females, but fathers do not pass traits associated with changes in mtDNA to their children.Occasionally, people with cyclic vomiting syndrome have a family history of the disorder that does not follow maternal inheritance. In these cases, the inheritance pattern is unknown.'},\n",

Although the 'disorder' was not life-threatening or seriously debilitating, it was a major annoyance. The informant, his mother, and a son (1 of his 5 children) experienced episodic increases in skin temperature associated with low or normal oral temperatures. The increased skin temperature was accompanied by severe headache, predominantly around the eyes, forehead and temples, and usually by nausea. The headache was aggravated by light. Vomiting often occurred late in the attack. The symptoms typically lasted for a few hours. Attacks often occurred when the subject was confined in a warm room with poor air circulation or was playing or sitting in the sun. The oldest affected member of the family, the grandmother, had onset at puberty and had not had attacks after hysterectomy at age 51. Her son first remembered symptoms at age 6, although the episodes became more frequent in his twenties. The grandson had onset at about age 5. Aspirin taken after the increase in skin temperature but before the onset of headache and nausea controlled the symptoms. Aspirin and caffeine partially relieved the symptoms after the headache had begun. The condition may be one of abnormal vasodilation at the skin surface leading to a higher skin temperature and lower internal temperature. Vasodilation may account for the headaches.Misc- Low or normal oral temperatures-Response to aspirinInheritance- Autosomal dominantNeuro- Severe headache, esp. around eyes, forehead and temples-Headache aggravated by lightGI- Nausea-VomitingSkin- Episodic increased skin temperature▲Close\"},\n",

(2015) reported a 15-year-old girl of Danish descent with herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis. After a week of headache, fever, and confusion, she developed nuchal rigidity, impaired consciousness, and seizures. Cerebrospinal fluid showed mononuclear pleocytosis and was positive for HSV-1. The patient had no previous history of increased susceptibility to infections; she had had routine childhood immunizations with no adverse events.Mork et al. (2015) reported a 34-year-old Danish man who developed adult-onset HSE. He had continued mild neurologic deficits, but no history of other severe infections. Clinical details were limited.InheritanceThe transmission pattern of herpes simplex encephalitis in the family reported by Andersen et al. (2015) was consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance.Molecular GeneticsIn a 15-year-old girl of Danish descent with herpes simplex encephalitis, Andersen et al. (2015) identified a heterozygous missense mutation in the IRF3 gene (R285Q; 603734.0001). The mutation, which was found by whole-exome sequencing, was also present in the unaffected father, consistent with incomplete penetrance. Patient peripheral blood cells showed normal expression of the mutant protein, but significantly impaired interferon (see, e.g., IFNB1, 147640) response upon stimulation with synthetic pathogen-associated molecular patterns as well as variably decreased responses to HSV-1, HSV-2, and HSV-8 compared to controls. In vitro functional expression assays in HEK293 cells showed that the mutant protein was not properly phosphorylated at S386 and did not form homodimers upon infection or pathway-specific stimulation. The TLR3 (603029)/TRIF (607601) pathway was most affected. There was no evidence of a dominant-negative effect, and Andersen et al. (2015) postulated that haploinsufficiency was responsible for the phenotype. Expression of wildtype IRF3 in patient cells restored the ability to express IFNB1 in response to infection.In a 34-year-old Danish man (P2) with adult-onset herpes simplex encephalitis, Mork et al. (2015) identified a heterozygous missense mutation in the IRF3 gene (A277T; 603734.0002). The mutation was found by whole-exome sequencing of a cohort of 16 patients with adult-onset HSE (including the patient reported by Andersen et al., 2015) and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed significantly lower IFNB1, CXCL10 (147310), and TNFA (191160) responses to poly(I;C) stimulation and/or HSV-1 infection compared to controls, suggesting defective antiviral response and a loss of function. The findings suggested that IRF3 variants may also contribute to HSE susceptibility in adults.Animal ModelMenachery et al. (2010) found that Irf3-null mice had impaired ability to control HSV-1 replication in brain tissue following corneal or intracranial infection compared to wildtype mice. Irf3-null mice had an increased inflammatory cytokine response and decreased interferon production in the brain, resulting in increased lethality. These findings demonstrated a critical role for IRF3 in the control of central nervous system infection following HSV-1 challenge.INHERITANCE- Autosomal dominantNEUROLOGICCentral Nervous System- Acute infectious encephalitis- Headache- Fluctuating consciousness- Seizures- Nuchal rigidity- Residual neurologic deficits may occur- Encephalitis seen on MRIIMMUNOLOGY- Increased susceptibility to herpes encephalitis (HSV-1)MISCELLANEOUS- Variable age at onset, range teens to adult- Two unrelated patients have been reported (last curated March 2018)MOLECULAR BASIS- Caused by mutation in the interferon regulatory factor-3 gene (IRF3,603734.0001)▲Close'},\n",

       "   'text': \"Ménière disease is a disorder of the inner ear that affects balance and hearing. This condition is characterized by sudden episodes of extreme dizziness (vertigo), a roaring sound in the ears (tinnitus), a feeling of pressure or fullness in the ears, and fluctuations in hearing. Episodes are often associated with nausea and vomiting, and they can severely disrupt activities of daily living.The episodes associated with Ménière disease generally last several hours. Studies suggest that episodes can be triggered by stress, tiredness (fatigue), emotional upset, illness, and dietary factors. The timing of these episodes is unpredictable; affected individuals may experience a cluster of episodes within a short period, followed by months or years without any symptoms.Ménière disease usually appears in adulthood, most often in a person's 40s or 50s. It is much less common in children and young adults. The symptoms of the disorder typically begin in one ear, although they may later involve both ears.Some people with Ménière disease have no symptoms of the disorder between episodes, particularly in the early stages of the disease. Over time, however, many affected individuals develop ongoing problems with unsteadiness, tinnitus, and a feeling of fullness in the ears. Additionally, permanent hearing loss eventually develops in many people with this disorder.FrequencyThe prevalence of Ménière disease varies in different geographic regions and ethnic groups. It appears to be more common in people of European descent than in those with other backgrounds. In the United States, there are an estimated 615,000 people with Ménière disease, and more than 45,000 new cases are diagnosed each year.CausesThe cause of Ménière disease is unknown, although it probably results from a combination of environmental and genetic factors.Ménière disease is thought to be related to abnormalities of the inner ear, which contains structures that are needed for normal hearing and balance. Episodes of vertigo, tinnitus, and hearing loss likely result from fluctuating amounts of fluid in the inner ear. These changes disrupt signals sent from the inner ear to the brain that are related to sound and the body's position and movement.Researchers have studied many possible risk factors for Ménière disease, including viral infections, trauma to the inner ear, noise pollution, allergies, abnormal immune system responses, and migraines. Studies have also examined changes in more than a dozen genes that might contribute to the signs and symptoms of this condition. However, none of the factors studied so far appears to play a major role in Ménière disease. Researchers are looking for additional environmental and genetic factors that are associated with this complex disorder.Inheritance PatternMost cases of Ménière disease are sporadic, which means they occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. A small percentage of all cases have been reported to run in families.When the disorder is familial, it most often has an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Autosomal dominant inheritance means one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase the risk of the disorder. However, no associated genes have been identified.\"},\n",

the fever normally presents as a high (above 39–40°C) and remittent, and is followed by extreme irritability.[15][16] Recently, it is reported to be present in patients with atypical or incomplete Kawasaki disease;[17][18] nevertheless, it is not present in 100% of cases.[19]The first day of fever is considered the first day of the illness,[14] and its duration is typically one to two weeks; in the absence of treatment, it may extend for three to four weeks.[3] Prolonged fever is associated with a higher incidence of cardiac involvement.[20] It responds partially to antipyretic drugs and does not cease with the introduction of antibiotics.[3] However, when appropriate therapy is started– intravenous immunoglobulin and aspirin– the fever subsides after two days.[21]Bilateral conjunctival inflammation has been reported to be the most common symptom after fever.[22][23] It typically involves the bulbar conjunctivae, is not accompanied by suppuration, and is not painful.[24] This usually begins shortly after the onset of fever during the acute stage of the disease.[14] Anterior uveitis may be present under slit-lamp examination.[25][26] Iritis can occur, too.[27] Keratic precipitates are another eye manifestation (detectable by a slit lamp, but are usually too small to be seen by the unaided eye).[14][28]Kawasaki disease also presents with a set of mouth symptoms, the most characteristic of which are a red tongue, swollen lips with vertical cracking, and bleeding.[29] The mucosa of the mouth and throat may be bright red, and the tongue may have a typical \"strawberry tongue\" appearance (marked redness with prominent gustative papillae).[3][30] These mouth symptoms are caused by necrotizing microvasculitis with fibrinoid necrosis.[29]Cervical lymphadenopathy is seen in 50% to 75% of children, whereas the other features are estimated to occur in 90%,[14][22] but sometimes it can be the dominant presenting symptom.[28][31] According to the diagnostic criteria, at least one impaired lymph node ≥ 15mm in diameter should be involved.[30] Affected lymph nodes are painless or minimally painful, nonfluctuant, and nonsuppurative; erythema of the neighboring skin may occur.[14] Children with fever and neck adenitis who do not respond to antibiotics should have Kawasaki disease considered as part of the differential diagnoses.[14]Less common manifestationsSystemManifestationsGITDiarrhea, chest pain, abdominal pain, vomiting, liver dysfunction, pancreatitis, hydrops gallbladder,[32] parotitis,[22][33] cholangitis, intussusception, intestinal pseudo-obstruction, ascites, splenic infarctionMSSPolyarthritis and arthralgiaCVSMyocarditis, pericarditis, tachycardia,[30] valvular heart diseaseGUUrethritis, prostatitis, cystitis, priapism, interstitial nephritis, orchitis, nephrotic syndromeCNSLethargy, semicoma,[22] aseptic meningitis, and sensorineural deafnessRSShortness of breath,[30] influenza-like illness, pleural effusion, atelectasisSkinErythema and induration at BCG vaccination site, Beau\\'s lines, and finger gangreneSource: review,[30] table.[34]In the acute phase of the disease, changes in the peripheral extremities can include erythema of the palms and soles, which is often striking with sharp demarcation[14] and often accompanied by painful, brawny edema of the dorsa of the hands or feet, so affected children frequently refuse to hold objects in their hands or to bear weight on their feet.[3][14] Later, during the convalescent or the subacute phase, desquamation of the fingers and toes usually begins in the periungual region within two to three weeks after the onset of fever and may extend to include the palms and soles.[35] Around 11% of children affected by the disease may continue skin-peeling for many years.[36] One to two months after the onset of fever, deep transverse grooves across the nails may develop (Beau\\'s lines),[37] and occasionally nails are shed.[37]The most common skin manifestation is a diffuse macular-papular erythematous rash, which is quite nonspecific.[38] The rash varies over time and is characteristically located on the trunk; it may further spread to involve the face, extremities, and perineum.[3] Many other forms of cutaneous lesions have been reported; they may include scarlatiniform, papular, urticariform, multiform-like erythema, and purpuric lesions; even micropustules were reported.[39][40] It can be polymorphic, not itchy, and normally observed up to the fifth day of fever.[41] However, it is never bullous or vesicular.[3]In the acute stage of Kawasaki disease, systemic inflammatory changes are evident in many organs.[42] Joint pain (arthralgia) and swelling, frequently symmetrical, andarthritis can also occur.[22] Myocarditis,[43] diarrhea,[30] pericarditis, valvulitis, aseptic meningitis, pneumonitis, lymphadenitis, and hepatitis may be present and are manifested by the presence of inflammatory cells in the affected tissues.[42] If left untreated, some symptoms will eventually relent, but coronary artery aneurysms will not improve, resulting in a significant risk of death or disability due to myocardial infarction.[30] If treated quickly, this risk can be mostly avoided and the course of illness cut short.[44]Signs and symptoms and time course of Kawasaki disease[14][45]Other reported nonspecific symptoms include cough, rhinorrhea, sputum, vomiting, headache, and seizure.[22]The course of the disease can be divided into three clinical phases.[46]The acute febrile phase, which usually lasts for one to two weeks, is characterized by fever, conjunctival injection, erythema of the oral mucosa, erythema and swelling of the hands and feet, rash, cervical adenopathy, aseptic meningitis, diarrhea, and hepatic dysfunction.[30] Myocarditis is common during this time, and a pericardial effusion may be present.[14] Coronary arteritis may be present, but aneurysms are generally not yet visible by echocardiography.The subacute phase begins when fever, rash, and lymphadenopathy resolve at about one to two weeks after the onset of fever, but irritability, anorexia, and conjunctival injection persist. Desquamation of the fingers and toes and thrombocytosis are seen during this stage, which generally lasts until about four weeks after the onset of fever. Coronary artery aneurysms usually develop during this time, and the risk for sudden death is highest.[14][47]The convalescent stage begins when all clinical signs of illness have disappeared, and continues until the sedimentation rate returns to normal, usually at six to eight weeks after the onset of illness.[30]Adult onset of Kawasaki disease is rare.[48] The presentation differs between adults and children: in particular, it seems that adults more often have cervical lymphadenopathy, hepatitis, and arthralgia.[30][48]Some children, especially young infants,[49] have atypical presentations without the classic set of symptoms.[46] Such presentations are associated with a higher risk of cardiac artery aneurysms.[14][50]Cardiac[edit]X-ray showing aneurysmal enlargement of the coronary arteries, which is a complication in a Kawasaki syndromeHeart complications are the most important aspect of Kawasaki disease, which is the leading cause of heart disease acquired in childhood in the United States and Japan.[30] In developed nations, it appears to have replaced acute rheumatic fever as the most common cause of acquired heart disease in children.[14] Coronary artery aneurysms occur as a sequela of the vasculitis in 20–25% of untreated children.[51] It is first detected at a mean of 10 days of illness and the peak frequency of coronary artery dilation or aneurysms occurs within four weeks of onset.[47] Aneurysms are classified into small (internal diameter of vessel wall <5mm), medium (diameter ranging from 5–8mm), and giant (diameter > 8mm).[30] Saccular and fusiform aneurysms usually develop between 18 and 25 days after the onset of illness.[14]Even when treated with high-dose IVIG regimens within the first 10 days of illness, 5% of children with Kawasaki disease develop at the least transient coronary artery dilation and 1% develop giant aneurysms.[52][53][54] Death can occur either due to myocardial infarction secondary to blood clot formation in a coronary artery aneurysm or to rupture of a large coronary artery aneurysm. Death is most common two to 12 weeks after the onset of illness.[14]Many risk factors predicting coronary artery aneurysms have been identified,[20] including persistent fever after IVIG therapy,[55][56] low hemoglobin concentrations, low albumin concentrations, high white-blood-cell count, high band count, high CRP concentrations, male sex, and age less than one year.[57]Coronary artery lesions resulting from Kawasaki disease change dynamically with time.[3] Resolution one to two years after the onset of the disease has been observed in half of vessels with coronary aneurysms.[58][59] Narrowing of the coronary artery, which occurs as a result of the healing process of the vessel wall, often leads to significant obstruction of the blood vessel andthe heart not receiving enough blood and oxygen.[58] This can eventually lead to heart muscle tissue death, i.e., myocardial infarction (MI).[58]MI caused by thrombotic occlusion in an aneurysmal, stenotic, or both aneurysmal and stenotic coronary artery is the main cause of death from Kawasaki disease.[60] The highest risk of MI occurs in the first year after the onset of the disease.[60] MI in children presents with different symptoms from those in adults. The main symptoms were shock, unrest, vomiting, and abdominal pain; chest pain was most common in older children.[60] Most of these children had the attack occurring during sleep or at rest, and around one-third of attacks were asymptomatic.[14]Valvular insufficiencies, particularly of mitral or tricuspid valves, are often observed in the acute phase of Kawasaki disease due to inflammation of the heart valve or inflammation of the heart muscle-induced myocardial dysfunction, regardless of coronary involvement.[58] These lesions mostly disappear with the resolution of acute illness,[61] but a very small group of the lesions persist and progress.[62] There is also late-onset aortic or mitral insufficiency caused by thickening or deformation of fibrosed valves, with the timing ranging from several months to years after the onset of Kawasaki disease.[63] Some of these lesions require valve replacement.[64]Other[edit]Other Kawasaki disease complications have been described, such as aneurysm of other arteries: aortic aneurysm,[65] with a higher number of reported cases involving the abdominal aorta,[66][67] axillary artery aneurysm,[68] brachiocephalic artery aneurysm,[69] aneurysm of iliac and femoral arteries, and renal artery aneurysm.[3][70] Other vascular complications can occur such as increased wall thickness and decreased distensibility of carotid arteries,[71] aorta,[72] and brachioradial artery.[73] This change in the vascular tone is secondary to endothelial dysfunction.[70] In addition, children with Kawasaki disease, with or without coronary artery complications, may have a more adverse cardiovascular risk profile,[73] such as high blood pressure, obesity, and abnormal serum lipid profile.[74]Gastrointestinal complications in Kawasaki disease are similar to those observed in Henoch–Schönlein purpura,[68] such as: intestinal obstruction,[75] colon swelling,[76] intestinal ischemia,[77] intestinal pseudo-obstruction,[78] and acute abdomen.[79]Eye changes associated with the disease have been described since the 1980s, being found as uveitis, iridocyclitis, conjunctival hemorrhage,[80][81][82] optic neuritis,[68] amaurosis, and ocular artery obstruction.[83] It can also be found as necrotizing vasculitis, progressing into peripheral gangrene.[84]The neurological complications per central nervous systemlesions are increasingly reported.[85] The neurological complications found are meningoencephalitis,[86] subdural effusion,[87][88] cerebral hypoperfusion,[89] cerebral ischemia and infarct,[90] cerebellar infarction,[91] manifesting with seizures, chorea, hemiplegia, mental confusion, lethargy and coma,[68] or even a cerebral infarction with no neurological manifestations.[90] Other neurological complications from cranial nerve involvement are reported as ataxia,[68] facial palsy,[92] and sensorineural hearing loss.[93][94] Behavioral changes are thought to be caused by localised cerebral hypoperfusion,[89] can include attention deficits, learning deficits, emotional disorders (emotional lability, fear of night, and night terrors), and internalization problems (anxious, depressive or aggressive behavior).[95][96]Causes[edit]The specific cause of Kawasaki disease is unknown.[97][98][99][100] A plausible explanation is that it may be caused by an infection that triggers an inappropriate immunologic cascade in a small number of genetically predisposed children.[6][101] The pathogenesis is complex and incompletely understood.[102] Various explanations exist.[100] (See #Classification)Circumstantial evidence points to an infectious cause.[103] Since recurrences are unusual in Kawasaki disease, it is thought that the trigger is more likely to be represented by a single pathogen, rather than a range of viral or bacterial agents.[104] Various candidates have been implicated, including upper respiratory tract infection by some novel RNA virus.[6]Despite intensive search, no single pathogen has been identified.[102] There has been debate as to whether the infectious agent might be a superantigen (i.e. one commonly associated with excessive immune system activation).[105][100] Current consensus favors an excessive immunologic response to a conventional antigen which usually provides future protection.[6] Research points to an unidentified ubiquitous virus,[106] possibly one that enters through the respiratory tract.[107]Seasonal trends in the appearance of new cases of Kawasaki disease have been linked to tropospheric wind patterns, which suggests wind-borne transport of something capable of triggering an immunologic cascade when inhaled by genetically susceptible children.[6] Winds blowing from central Asia correlate with numbers of new cases of Kawasaki disease in Japan, Hawaii, and San Diego.[108] These associations are themselves modulated by seasonal and interannual events in the El Niño–Southern Oscillation in winds and sea surface temperatures over the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean.[109] Efforts have been made to identify a possible pathogen in air-filters flown at altitude above Japan.[110] One source has been suggested in northeastern China.[6][111]Genetics[edit]Genetic susceptibility is suggested by increased incidence among children of Japanese descent around the world, and also among close and extended family members of affected people.[6]Genetic factors are also thought to influence development of coronary artery aneurysms and response to treatment.[112]The exact genetic contribution remains unknown.[113] Genome-wide association studies and studies of individual candidate genes have together helped identify specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), mostly found in genes with immune regulatory functions.[112] The associated genes and their levels of expression appear to vary among different ethnic groups, both with Asian and non-Asian backgrounds.[114]SNPs in FCGR2A, CASP3, BLK, ITPKC, CD40 and ORAI1 have all been linked to susceptibility, prognosis, and risk of developing coronary artery aneurysms.[114] Various other possible susceptibility genes have been proposed, including polymorphisms in the HLA region, but their significance is disputed.[113] Genetic susceptibility to Kawasaki disease appears complex.[115] Gene–gene interactions also seem to affect susceptibility and prognosis.[114] At an epigenetic level, altered DNA methylation has been proposed as an early mechanistic factor during the acute phase of the disease.[114]Diagnosis[edit]Criteria for diagnosisFever of ≥5 days\\' duration associated with at least four† of these five changesBilateral nonsuppurative conjunctivitisOne or more changes of the mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract, including throat redness, dry cracked lips, red lips, and \"strawberry\" tongueOne or more changes of the arms and legs, including redness, swelling, skin peeling around the nails, and generalized peelingPolymorphous rash, primarily truncalLarge lymph nodes in the neck (>15mm in size)Disease cannot be explained by some other known disease process†A diagnosis of Kawasaki disease can be made if fever and only three changes are present if coronary artery disease is documented by two-dimensional echocardiography or coronary angiography.Source: Nelson\\'s essentials of pediatrics,[116] Review[117]Angiography showing ectatic LAD, with largest aneurysm = 6.5 mm in diameterSince no specific laboratory test exists for Kawasaki disease, diagnosis must be based on clinical signs and symptoms, together with laboratory findings.[8] Timely diagnosis requires careful history-taking and thorough physical examination.[118] Establishing the diagnosis is difficult, especially early in the course of the illness, and frequently children are not diagnosed until they have seen several health-care providers. Many other serious illnesses can cause similar symptoms, and must be considered in the differential diagnosis, including scarlet fever, toxic shock syndrome, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and childhood mercury poisoning (infantile acrodynia).[119]Classically, five days of fever[120] plus four of five diagnostic criteria must be met to establish the diagnosis. The criteria are:[121]erythema of the lips or oral cavity or cracking of the lipsrash on the trunkswelling or erythema of the hands or feetred eyes (conjunctival injection)swollen lymph node in the neck of at least 15mmMany children, especially infants, eventually diagnosed with Kawasaki disease, do not exhibit all of the above criteria. In fact, many experts now recommend treating for Kawasaki disease even if only three days of fever have passed and at least three diagnostic criteria are present, especially if other tests reveal abnormalities consistent with Kawasaki disease. In addition, the diagnosis can be made purely by the detection of coronary artery aneurysms in the proper clinical setting.[citation needed]Investigations[edit]A physical examination will demonstrate many of the features listed above.Blood testsComplete blood count may reveal normocytic anemia and eventually thrombocytosis.Erythrocyte sedimentation rate will be elevated.C-reactive protein will be elevated.Liver function tests may show evidence of hepatic inflammation and low serum albumin levels.[122]Other optional tests include:Electrocardiogram may show evidence of ventricular dysfunction or, occasionally, arrhythmia due to myocarditis.Echocardiogram may show subtle coronary artery changes or, later, true aneurysms.Ultrasound or computerized tomography may show hydrops (enlargement) of the gallbladder.Urinalysis may show white blood cells and protein in the urine (pyuria and proteinuria) without evidence of bacterial growth.Lumbar puncture may show evidence of aseptic meningitis.Angiography was historically used to detect coronary artery aneurysms, and remains the gold standard for their detection, but is rarely used today unless coronary artery aneurysms have already been detected by echocardiography.Biopsy is rarely performed, as it is not necessary for diagnosis.[7]Subtypes[edit]Based on clinical findings, a diagnostic distinction may be made between the \\'classic\\' / \\'typical\\' presentation of Kawasaki disease and \\'incomplete\\' / \\'atypical\\' presentation of a \"suspected\" form of the disease.[6] Regarding \\'incomplete\\' / \\'atypical\\' presentation, American Heart Association guidelines state that Kawasaki disease \"should be considered in the differential diagnosis of prolonged unexplained fever in childhood associated with any of the principal clinical features of the disease, and the diagnosis can be considered confirmed when coronary artery aneurysms are identified in such patients by echocardiography.\"[6]A further distinction between \\'incomplete\\' and \\'atypical\\' subtypes may also be made in the presence of non-typical symptoms.[46]Case definition[edit]For study purposes, including vaccine safety monitoring, an international case definition has been proposed to categorize \\'definite\\' (i.e. complete/incomplete), \\'probable\\' and \\'possible\\' cases of Kawasaki disease.[123]Differential diagnosis[edit]The broadness of the differential diagnosis is a challenge to timely diagnosis of Kawasaki disease.[8] Infectious and noninfectious conditions requiring consideration include: measles and other viral infections (e.g. adenovirus, enterovirus); staphylococcal and streptococcal toxin-mediated diseases such as scarlet fever and toxic shock syndrome; drug hypersensitivity reactions (including Stevens Johnson syndrome); systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis; Rocky Mountain spotted fever or other rickettsial infections; and leptospirosis.[6] Infectious conditions that can mimic Kawasaki disease include periorbital cellulitis, peritonsillar abscess, retropharyngeal abscess, cervical lymphadenitis, parvovirus B19, mononucleosis, rheumatic fever, meningitis, staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and Lyme disease.[7]Kawasaki-like disease temporally associated with COVID-19[edit]In 2020, reports of a Kawasaki-like disease following exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, emerged in the US and Europe.[9] The World Health Organization is examining possible links with COVID-19.[124] This emerging condition was named \\'paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome\\' by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health,[4] and \\'multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children\\' by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.[125] Guidance for diagnosis and reporting of cases has been issued by these organizations.[4][124][125]Classification[edit]Debate has occurred about whether Kawasaki disease should be viewed as a characteristic immune response to some infectiouspathogen, as an autoimmune process, or as an autoinflammatory disease (i.e. involving innate rather than adaptive immune pathways).[100] Overall, immunological research suggests that Kawasaki disease is associated with a response to a conventional antigen (rather than a superantigen) that involves both activation of the innate immune system and also features of an adaptive immune response.[6][126] Identification of the exact nature of the immune process involved in Kawasaki disease could help guide research aimed at improving clinical management.[100]Inflammation, or vasculitis, of the arteries and veins occurs throughout the body, usually caused by increased production of the cells of the immune system to a pathogen, or autoimmunity.[127] Systemic vasculitides may be classified according to the type of cells involved in the proliferation, as well as the specific type of tissue damage occurring within the vein or arterial walls.[127] Under this classification scheme for systemic vasculitis, Kawasaki disease is considered to be a necrotizing vasculitis (also called necrotizing angiitis), which may be identified histologically by the occurrence of necrosis (tissue death), fibrosis, and proliferation of cells associated with inflammation in the inner layer of the vascular wall.[127][128]Other diseases involving necrotizing vasculitis include polyarteritis nodosa, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, Henoch–Schönlein purpura, and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis.[127]Kawasaki disease may be further classified as a medium-sized vessel vasculitis, affecting medium- and small-sized blood vessels,[42][129][130] such as the smaller cutaneous vasculature (veins and arteries in the skin) that range from 50 to 100µm in diameter.[30][131] Kawasaki disease is also considered to be a primary childhood vasculitis, a disorder associated with vasculitis that mainly affects children under the age of 18.[117][132] A recent, consensus-based evaluation of vasculitides occurring primarily in children resulted in a classification scheme for these disorders, to distinguish them and suggest a more concrete set of diagnostic criteria for each.[117] Within this classification of childhood vasculitides, Kawasaki disease is, again, a predominantly medium-sized vessel vasculitis.[117]It can also be classed as an autoimmune form of vasculitis.[3] It is not associated with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, unlike other vasculitic disorders associated with them (such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis, and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis).[127][133] This form of categorization is relevant for appropriate treatment.[134]Treatment[edit]Children with Kawasaki disease should be hospitalized and cared for by a physician who has experience with this disease. In an academic medical center, care is often shared between pediatric cardiology, pediatric rheumatology, and pediatric infectious disease specialists (although no specific infectious agent has yet been identified).[135] To prevent damage to coronary arteries, treatment should be started immediately following the diagnosis.[citation needed]Intravenous immunoglobulin(IVIG) is the standard treatment for Kawasaki disease[136] and is administered in high doses with marked improvement usually noted within 24 hours. If the fever does not respond, an additional dose may be considered. In rare cases, a third dose may be given. IVIG by is most useful within the first seven days of fever onset, to prevent coronary artery aneurysm. IVIG given within the first 10 days of the disease reduces the risk of damage to the coronary arteries in children, without serious adverse effects.[136]Salicylate therapy, particularly aspirin, remains an important part of the treatment (though questioned by some)[137] but salicylates alone are not as effective as IVIG. There is limited evidence to indicate whether children should continue to receive salicylate as part of their treatment.[138] Aspirin therapy is started at high doses until the fever subsides, and then is continued at a low dose when the patient returns home, usually for two months to prevent blood clots from forming. Except for Kawasaki disease and a few other indications, aspirin is otherwise normally not recommended for children due to its association with Reye syndrome. Because children with Kawasaki disease will be taking aspirin for up to several months, vaccination against varicella and influenza is required, as these infections are most likely to cause Reye syndrome.[139]High-dose aspirin is associated with anemia and does not confer benefit to disease outcomes.[140]About 15-20% of children following the initial IVIG infusion show persistent or recurrent fever and are classified as IVIG-resistant. While the use of TNF alpha blockers (TNF-α) may reduce treatment resistance and the infusion reaction after treatment initiation, further research is needed.[141]Corticosteroids have also been used,[142]especially when other treatments fail or symptoms recur, but in a randomized controlled trial, the addition of corticosteroid to immune globulin and aspirin did not improve outcome.[143] Additionally, corticosteroid use in the setting of Kawasaki disease is associated with increased risk of coronary artery aneurysm, so its use is generally contraindicated in this setting.In cases of Kawasaki disease refractory to IVIG, cyclophosphamide and plasma exchange have been investigated as possible treatments, with variable outcomes. However, a Cochrane review published in 2017 found that, in children, the use of corticosteroids in the acute phase of KD was associated with improved coronary artery abnormalities, shorter hospital stays, a decreased duration of clinical symptoms, and reduced inflammatory marker levels. Patient populations based in Asia, people with higher risk scores, and those receiving longer steroid treatment may have greater benefit from steroid use.[144]Prognosis[edit]With early treatment, rapid recovery from the acute symptoms can be expected, and the risk of coronary artery aneurysms is greatly reduced. Untreated, the acute symptoms of Kawasaki disease are self-limited (i.e. the patient will recover eventually), but the risk of coronary artery involvement is much greater, even many years later. Many cases of myocardial infarction in young adults have now been attributed to Kawasaki disease that went undiagnosed during childhood.[6] Overall, about 2% of patients die from complications of coronary vasculitis.[citation needed]Laboratory evidence of increased inflammation combined with demographic features (male sex, age less than six months or greater than eight years) and incomplete response to IVIG therapy create a profile of a high-risk patient with Kawasaki disease.[57][145] The likelihood that an aneurysm will resolve appears to be determined in large measure by its initial size, in which the smaller aneurysms have a greater likelihood of regression.[146][147] Other factors are positively associated with the regression of aneurysms, including being younger than a year old at the onset of Kawasaki disease, fusiform rather than saccular aneurysm morphology, and an aneurysm location in a distal coronary segment.[59] The highest rate of progression to stenosis occurs among those who develop large aneurysms.[3] The worst prognosis occurs in children with giant aneurysms.[148] This severe outcome may require further treatment such as percutaneous transluminal angioplasty,[149] coronary artery stenting,[150] bypass grafting,[151] and even cardiac transplantation.[152]A relapse of symptoms may occur soon after initial treatment with IVIG. This usually requires rehospitalization and retreatment. Treatment with IVIG can cause allergic and nonallergic acute reactions, aseptic meningitis, fluid overload, and rarely, other serious reactions. Overall, life-threatening complications resulting from therapy for Kawasaki disease are exceedingly rare, especially compared with the risk of nontreatment. Evidence indicates Kawasaki disease produces altered lipid metabolism that persists beyond the clinical resolution of the disease.[citation needed]Rarely, recurrence can occur in Kawasaki disease with or without treatment.[153][154]Epidemiology[edit]Kawasaki disease affects boys more than girls, with people of Asian ethnicity, particularly Japanese people. The higher incidence in Asian populations is thought to be linked to genetic susceptibility.[155] Incidence rates vary between countries.Currently, Kawasaki disease is the most commonly diagnosed pediatric vasculitis in the world.By far, the highest incidence of Kawasaki disease occurs in Japan, with the most recent study placing the attack rate at 218.6 per 100,000 children less than five years of age (about one in 450 children).At this present attack rate, more than one in 150 children in Japan will develop Kawasaki disease during their lifetimes.[citation needed]However, its incidence in the United States is increasing. Kawasaki disease is predominantly a disease of young children, with 80% of patients younger than five years of age. About 2,000–4,000 cases are identified in the U.S. each year (9 to 19 per 100,000 children younger than five years of age).[135][156][157] In the continental United States, Kawasaki disease is more common during the winter and early spring, boys with the disease outnumber girls by ≈1.5–1.7:1, and 76% of affected children are less than years of age.[158]In the United Kingdom, prior to 2000, it was diagnosed in fewer than one in every 25,000 people per year.[159] Incidence of the disease doubled from 1991 to 2000, however, with four cases per 100,000 children in 1991 compared with a rise of eight cases per 100,000 in 2000.[160] By 2017, this figure had risen to 12 in 100,000 people with 419 diagnosed cases of Kawasaki disease in the United Kingdom.[161]In Japan, the rate is 240 in every 100,000 people.[162]Coronary artery aneurysms due to Kawasaki disease are believed to account for 5% of acute coronary syndrome cases in adults under 40 years of age.[6]History[edit]The disease was first reported by Tomisaku Kawasaki in a four-year-old child with a rash and fever at the Red Cross Hospital in Tokyo in January 1961, and he later published a report on 50 similar cases.[163] Later, Kawasaki and colleagues were persuaded of definite cardiac involvement when they studied and reported 23 cases, of which 11 (48%) patients had abnormalities detected by an electrocardiogram.[164] In 1974, the first description of this disorder was published in the English-language literature.[165] In 1976, Melish et al. described the same illness in 16 children in Hawaii.[166] Melish and Kawasaki had independently developed the same diagnostic criteria for the disorder, which are still used today to make the diagnosis of classic Kawasaki disease. Dr. Kawasaki died on June 5, 2020 at the age of 95.[167]A question was raised whether the disease only started during the period between 1960 and 1970, but later a preserved heart of a seven-year-old boy who died in 1870 was examined and showed three aneurysms of the coronary arteries with clots, as well as pathologic changes consistent with Kawasaki disease.[168] Kawasaki disease is now recognized worldwide. Why cases began to emerge across all continents around the 1960s and 1970s is unclear.[169] Possible explanations could include confusion with other diseases such as scarlet fever, and easier recognition stemming from modern healthcare factors such as the widespread use of antibiotics.[169] In particular, old pathological descriptions from Western countries of infantile polyarteritis nodosa coincide with reports of fatal cases of Kawasaki disease.[6]In the United States and other developed nations, Kawasaki disease appears to have replaced acute rheumatic fever as the most common cause of acquired heart disease in children.[170]References[edit]^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}\"Kawasaki Disease\".

       "   'text': \"Congenital polycystic dilatation of intrahepatic bile ducts was first described by Caroli et al. (1958). The condition is characterized by polycystic segmental dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts and a marked predisposition to cholangitis and liver abscess. As indicated in the discussion of infantile polycystic kidney disease (263200), involvement of the liver compatible with Caroli disease is seen in association with that of kidney disease and possibly also with the adult form of polycystic kidney disease. It is possible that isolated Caroli disease occurs as a genetic entity in some families.Tsuchida et al. (1995) reported a family in which a 5-year-old girl was found to have Caroli disease and investigated for recurrent episodes of fever, epigastric pain, and vomiting with associated hepatomegaly. By intravenous cholangiography, her 9-year-old brother was found at the same time to have mottled radiopacities in the liver identical to his sister's. He remained asymptomatic, however, until the age of 30 when he developed bleeding esophageal varices indicative of portal hypertension. The mother was found to have a completely normal intrahepatic biliary tree by intravenous cholangiography. The father was found by ultrasonography and CT scan to have numerous small cysts in the liver. None of the 3 had renal cysts. Tsuchida et al. (1995) suggested autosomal dominant inheritance. Two affected brothers who died at ages 40 and 33, respectively, were reported by Hunter et al. (1966). Turnberg et al. (1968) described a 27-year-old patient whose father died of 'gastric hemorrhage' and a brother died at age 6 years with 'enlarged liver.'Adeva et al. (2006) retrospectively reviewed the clinical records, and where possible performed mutation screening of the PKHD1 gene (606702), in patients diagnosed with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD; 263200) or congenital hepatic fibrosis seen at the Mayo Clinic from 1961 to 2004. Two-thirds of the patients presented after the age of 1 year, with one third after age 20 years. In this group, complications of liver disease were the most common reasons for seeking medical attention. On follow-up, symptoms associated with portal hypertension or cholangitis (in patients with Caroli disease) were the most common disease manifestations. Eight of 14 patients with MRI studies had dilated intrahepatic bile ducts consistent with Caroli disease. Although ARPKD had been generally considered an infantile disorder with typical presentation of greatly enlarged echogenic kidneys detected in utero or within the neonatal period, often resulting in neonatal demise, Adeva et al. (2006) concluded that relatively isolated congenital hepatic fibrosis and/or Caroli disease are part of the ARPKD spectrum.Misc- Polycystic kidney disease association-Recurrent episodic feverGI- Congenital polycystic dilatation of intrahepatic bile ducts-Cholangitis-Liver abscess-Epigastric pain-Vomiting-Hepatomegaly-Bleeding esophageal varices-Portal hypertensionInheritance- Autosomal dominant▲Close\"},\n",

(1982) described a family in which 4 females in 3 successive generations shared the clinical triad of fever, hypertension, and juvenile polyarthritis, along with the pathologic feature of noncaseating granulomas in vascular and extravascular distribution. The proband was a 5-year-old white girl who at age 8 months developed fever and a persistent macular erythematous rash. At 10 months nodules were noted on her wrists. At 18 months she had fever and symmetrical swelling, warmth and redness of hands, knees, and ankles, and pericardial effusion was noted. At age 4.5 years she had spiking fever, headache, and a seizure, with blood pressure of 200-140 mm Hg, bilateral iritis, papilledema, and pericardial friction rub. Abdominal aortograms showed beading of the splenic, renal and iliac arteries, proximal stenosis and poststenotic dilatation, and intrarenal arterial stenoses. Skin biopsy showed noncaseating granulomatous inflammation. After 1 year of therapy with prednisone and cyclophosphamide, aortograms showed dramatic improvement. In her mother, the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis with features of Still disease was made at age 8 years; in her twenties, she had 5 episodes of unexplained fever. At age 28, she developed fever, jaundice, and elevated alkaline phosphatase; liver biopsy showed noncaseating granulomas. At age 35 she had a pleural effusion. The proband's maternal grandmother, aged 62, had juvenile-onset polyarthritis, unexplained fever only during childhood, recent chronic iritis and noncaseating granulomas on conjunctival biopsy. The proband's maternal aunt, who died at age 24, had rheumatoid arthritis with features of Still disease beginning at age 8 years. Throughout her life, she had recurrent episodes of unexplained fever. In a final hospitalization she had seizures and severe hypertension. Autopsy showed systemic noncaseating granulomas.Di Liberti (1982) suggested that the patients reported by Rotenstein et al. (1982) had the same disorder as that in a family he and his associates presented at the 1974 Birth Defects Conference in Newport Beach, California. Five persons in 2 generations had arthritis beginning in early childhood and initially affecting the hands, wrists and ankles. The dorsal tendon sheaths of the hands and feet were particularly involved. By late childhood the swelling had diminished, but flexion contractures of the fingers and elbows were evident. Periarticular osteoporosis was also present. One child had iritis with prominent synechiae. He died suddenly at play, and at autopsy had granulomatous arteritis of the aorta, coronary arteries, kidneys, liver and other organs. The coronary arteries were almost totally occluded. Although some features suggested childhood sarcoidosis, the conspicuous arteritis is probably a differentiating feature.Malleson et al. (1981) reported a Mexican-American family in which the mother and a daughter and 3 sons had camptodactyly and arthritis. Another son had arthritis but no camptodactyly. One of the affected sons died at age 4.5 years and was shown to have granulomatous arteritis which affected the aorta, pericardium, myocardium, and coronary arteries. He had also had chronic bilateral iridocyclitis. Some of these features suggest Jabs syndrome (186580).INHERITANCE- Autosomal dominantHEAD & NECKEyes- Iritis- PapilledemaCARDIOVASCULARHeart- Pericardial effusionVascular- Granulomatous coronary arteritis- Abdominal aortograms show beading of the splenic, renal and iliac arteries, proximal stenosis and poststenotic dilatation, and intrarenal arterial stenosesRESPIRATORYLung- Pleural effusionSKIN, NAILS, & HAIRSkin- Macular erythematous rash- Subcutaneous nodules- JaundiceNEUROLOGICCentral Nervous System- Headache- SeizuresMETABOLIC FEATURES- FeverENDOCRINE FEATURES- HypertensionIMMUNOLOGY- Juvenile polyarthritis- Rheumatoid arthritis- Noncaseating granulomas, vascular and extravascular, especially hepaticLABORATORY ABNORMALITIES- Elevated alkaline phosphatase▲Close\"},\n",

Occlusion of the left popliteal artery was discovered. Laboratory investigations showed marked diminution in sensitivity of platelets to prostacyclin and a defect in platelet prostacyclin receptor (600022) was discovered. Because of reduction in the value of PGI2-receptor of the high affinity type in a brother and to some extent in both parents, the defect was thought to be hereditary. In 2 males, aged 35 and 38 years, presenting with myocardial infarction, Sinzinger et al. (1991) found abnormal conversion of exogenous 14C-arachidonic acid by platelets incubated in vitro. Neither of the patient's platelets showed evidence of a lipoxygenase pathway. Platelet thromboxane formation from exogenous and endogenous substrate was high, while the platelet aggregation responses were normal. A myeloproliferative syndrome was suggested by findings of bone marrow aspiration.Inheritance- Autosomal recessiveLab- Marked diminution in sensitivity of platelets to prostacyclin-Platelet prostacyclin receptor defectVascular- Intermittent claudication-Popliteal artery occlusion▲Close\"},\n",

       "   'text': 'A number sign (#) is used with this entry because of evidence that autosomal dominant mental retardation-56 (MRD56) is caused by heterozygous mutation in the CLTC gene (118955) on chromosome 17q23.Clinical FeaturesDeMari et al. (2016) reported a 3.5-year-old girl, conceived through in vitro fertilization, with global developmental delay, intellectual disability, absent language, hypotonia, and inability to walk. Her neonatal period was notable for hypoglycemia, apnea, bradycardia, hyperbilirubinemia, subdural hematoma, laryngomalacia, and feeding difficulties requiring admission to the NICU for a month. She also had hydrocephalus, hypothyroidism, and vitamin K-dependent clotting factor deficiency, and she developed a mediastinal ganglioneuroblastoma. Dysmorphic features included low-set ears, depressed nasal bridge, anteverted nares, and widely spaced and inverted nipples. She did not have seizures; brain imaging and EEG were normal. At age 3.5 years, she was socially alert and interactive and was making some developmental progress.Hamdan et al. (2017) reported 12 unrelated patients with MRD56. The patients ranged in age from 3 to 30 years. All had global developmental delay of varying degree and intellectual disability that ranged from borderline to severe. Most had hypotonia, delayed walking, poor fine motor skills, clumsiness, and poor or absent speech. Several patients were able to attend special schools, whereas a few patients had more significant disability, never achieving ambulation or speech. Several patients had nonspecific and variable dysmorphic features, such as upslanting palpebral fissures, long philtrum, thin upper lip, open mouth, high-arched palate, and prominent ears. Four patients had seizures with onset in the first years of life, and a fifth patient had 1 seizure at age 14 years without recurrence. Two patients had had pharmacoresistant epilepsy with a preponderance of myoclonic and generalized tonic-clonic seizures, whereas 2 had seizures that could be controlled. Other more variable features included ataxia, spasticity, paraparesis, acquired microcephaly, oral and motor apraxia, and behavioral abnormalities, such as impulsivity and attention deficits. Brain imaging was normal in most patients, but showed nonspecific abnormalities in others, including pontocerebellar atrophy, thin corpus callosum, delayed myelination, and abnormal T2-weighed signals.Molecular GeneticsIn a 3.5-year-old girl, conceived by in vitro fertilization, with MRD56, DeMari et al. (2016) identified a de novo heterozygous frameshift mutation in the CLTC gene (118955.0001). The mutation was found by exome sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Functional studies of the variant and studies of patient cells were not performed, but the authors postulated haploinsufficiency of CLTC as the pathogenetic mechanism. DeMari et al. (2016) noted that CLTC is highly expressed in the brain and plays a role in neuronal transmission by facilitating the recycling and/or release of vesicles at the presynaptic termini of neurons.In 12 unrelated patients with MRD56, Hamdan et al. (2017) identified de novo heterozygous missense mutations in the CLTC gene (see, e.g., 118955.0002-118955.0006). The mutations were found by whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing of several cohorts of patients with developmental delay and epilepsy. There were 5 truncating mutations, 2 small in-frame deletions, 1 splice site mutation, and 3 missense mutations, 1 of which was recurrent and found in 3 unrelated patients. Individuals with refractory epilepsy were found to carry variants in the first section of the clathrin light chain-binding domain, whereas truncating mutations affecting the C terminus tended to be associated with hypotonia, global developmental delay, and intellectual disability. Studies of patient cells and functional studies of the variants were not performed. Hamdan et al. (2017) noted that CLTC is involved in endocytosis, intracellular trafficking, and synaptic recycling.INHERITANCE- Autosomal dominantHEAD & NECKHead- Microcephaly, acquiredFace- Dysmorphic features, nonspecific, variable (in some patients)- Long philtrumEars- Prominent earsEyes- Upslanting palpebral fissuresMouth- High-arched palate- Open mouth- Thin upper lip- Oral apraxiaMUSCLE, SOFT TISSUES- HypotoniaNEUROLOGICCentral Nervous System- Global developmental delay- Intellectual disability- Seizures (in some patients)- Ataxia- Spasticity- Paraparesis- Brain abnormalities, nonspecific and variable (in some patients)Behavioral Psychiatric Manifestations- Impulsivity- Attention deficitMISCELLANEOUS- Onset in infancy or first years of life- Highly variable severity- De novo mutationMOLECULAR BASIS- Caused by mutation in the clathrin heavy polypeptide gene (CLTC,118955.0001)▲Close'},\n",

(1992) reported the cases of 2 sisters who presented in the first year of life because of failure to thrive and were found to have a severe proximal tubulopathy with polyuria and loss of potassium, sodium, calcium, and chloride. A mottled pigmentation was present in photoexposed areas (forearms, legs, and cheeks), and episodes of cold-triggered erythrocyanosis of the toes and fingers were noted. The older sister developed fatal diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration at the age of 5 years. The second sister developed a severe episode of diarrhea and dehydration at the age of 3 years. Although she survived this episode, she subsequently developed extraocular muscle palsy, lid ptosis, pigmentary deposits of the retina, and extinguished electroretinogram. Osteoporosis and rickets were detected as well as liver enlargement. In her fifth year, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus was found, and she gradually developed cerebellar ataxia and hypotonia with deafness, blindness, myoclonic jerks, and psychomotor regression. Death occurred at the age of 8 years. In this family the mother had gradually developed bilateral extraocular muscle palsy with lid ptosis and micropunctated tapetoretinal degeneration in early adulthood. She also developed myopia, hypoacusis, and muscle weakness after her first pregnancy. The 2 sisters described were her only children. Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of lymphocyte DNA, Rotig et al. (1992) detected minute amounts of duplicated mtDNA molecules in the mother. Skeletal muscle and lymphocytes of the younger sister had demonstrated complex III deficiency. Southern blot analysis provided evidence for a heteroplasmic partial duplication of mtDNA (26 kb), involving one full-length and one partly deleted mitochondrial genome and with a single abnormal junction between the genes for ATPase 6 and cytochrome b.INHERITANCE- MitochondrialGROWTHOther- Failure to thriveHEAD & NECKEars- DeafnessEyes- Extraocular muscle palsy- Ptosis- Pigmentary retinal deposits- Blindness- Extinguished electroretinogramABDOMENLiver- HepatomegalyGastrointestinal- Diarrhea- VomitingGENITOURINARYKidneys- Proximal tubulopathy- PolyuriaSKELETAL- Osteoporosis- RicketsSKIN, NAILS, & HAIRSkin- Mottled pigmentation of photoexposed areas- Episodic cold-triggered erythrocyanosis of toes and fingersNEUROLOGICCentral Nervous System- Ataxia- Hypotonia- Myoclonic jerks- Psychomotor regressionMETABOLIC FEATURES- DehydrationENDOCRINE FEATURES- Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitusLABORATORY ABNORMALITIES- Urinary loss of potassium, sodium, calcium, and chloride- Heteroplasmic partial duplication of mtDNAMOLECULAR BASIS- Caused by partial duplication of mtDNA▲Close'},\n",

Several other similar episodes followed during one of which the child died at the age of 27 months. The second twin first displayed sleep apnea at age 27 months, shortly after the death of her twin sister. She died after an apneic episode at the age of 31 months. A brother died at 18 months after a single episode of sleep apnea.

       "   'text': 'Hereditary angioedema is a disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of severe swelling (angioedema). The most common areas of the body to develop swelling are the limbs, face, intestinal tract, and airway. Minor trauma or stress may trigger an attack, but swelling often occurs without a known trigger. Episodes involving the intestinal tract cause severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Swelling in the airway can restrict breathing and lead to life-threatening obstruction of the airway. About one-third of people with this condition develop a non-itchy rash called erythema marginatum during an attack.Symptoms of hereditary angioedema typically begin in childhood and worsen during puberty.On average, untreated individuals have an attack every 1 to 2 weeks, and most episodes last for about 3 to 4 days. The frequency and duration of attacks vary greatly among people with hereditary angioedema, even among people in the same family.There are three types of hereditary angioedema, called types I, II, and III, which can be distinguished by their underlying causes and levels of a protein called C1 inhibitor in the blood. The different types have similar signs and symptoms. Type III was originally thought to occur only in women, but families with affected males have been identified.FrequencyHereditary angioedema is estimated to affect 1 in 50,000 people. Type I is the most common, accounting for 85 percent of cases. Type II occurs in 15 percent of cases, and type III is very rare.CausesMutations in the SERPING1 gene cause hereditary angioedema type I and type II. The SERPING1 gene provides instructions for making the C1 inhibitor protein, which is important for controlling inflammation. C1 inhibitor blocks the activity of certain proteins that promote inflammation. Mutations that cause hereditary angioedema type I lead to reduced levels of C1 inhibitor in the blood, while mutations that cause type II result in the production of a C1 inhibitor that functions abnormally. Without the proper levels of functional C1 inhibitor, excessive amounts of a protein fragment (peptide) called bradykinin are generated. Bradykinin promotes inflammation by increasing the leakage of fluid through the walls of blood vessels into body tissues. Excessive accumulation of fluids in body tissues causes the episodes of swelling seen in individuals with hereditary angioedema type I and type II.Mutations in the F12 gene are associated with some cases of hereditary angioedema type III. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called coagulation factor XII. In addition to playing a critical role in blood clotting (coagulation), factor XII is also an important stimulator of inflammation and is involved in the production of bradykinin. Certain mutations in the F12 gene result in the production of factor XII with increased activity. As a result, more bradykinin is generated and blood vessel walls become more leaky, which leads to episodes of swelling in people with hereditary angioedema type III.The cause of other cases of hereditary angioedema type III remains unknown. Mutations in one or more as-yet unidentified genes may be responsible for the disorder in these cases.Learn more about the genes associated with Hereditary angioedemaF12SERPING1Inheritance PatternThis condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. Other cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.'},\n",

Excessive salivation, also known as sialorrhea gravidarum, is another symptom experienced by some women.Hyperemesis gravidarum tends to occur in the first trimester of pregnancy[12] and lasts significantly longer than morning sickness. While most women will experience near-complete relief of morning sickness symptoms near the beginning of their second trimester, some sufferers of HG will experience severe symptoms until they give birth to their baby, and sometimes even after giving birth.[15]A small percentage rarely vomit, but the nausea still causes most (if not all) of the same issues that hyperemesis with vomiting does.[citation needed]Causes[edit]There are numerous theories regarding the cause of HG, but the cause remains controversial. It is thought that HG is due to a combination of factors which may vary between women and include genetics.[11] Women with family members who had HG are more likely to develop the disease.[16]One factor is an adverse reaction to the hormonal changes of pregnancy, in particular, elevated levels of beta human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG).[17][18] This theory would also explain why hyperemesis gravidarum is most frequently encountered in the first trimester (often around 8–12 weeks of gestation), as β-hCG levels are highest at that time and decline afterward. Another postulated cause of HG is an increase in maternal levels of estrogens (decreasing intestinal motility and gastric emptying leading to nausea/vomiting).[11]Pathophysiology[edit]Morning sicknessAlthough the pathophysiology of HG is poorly understood, the most commonly accepted theory suggests that levels of β-hCG are associated with it.[5] Leptin, a hormone that inhibits hunger, may also play a role.[19]Possible pathophysiological processes involved are summarized in the following table:[20]SourceCausePathophysiologyPlacentaβ-hCGDistention of the gastrointestinal tractCrossover with TSH, causing gestational thyrotoxicosis[5]PlacentaCorpus luteumEstrogenProgesteroneDecreased gut mobilityElevated liver enzymesDecreased lower esophageal sphincter pressureIncreased levels of sex steroids in hepatic portal system[21]Gastrointestinal tractHelicobacter pyloriIncreased steroid levels in circulation[22]Diagnosis[edit]Hyperemesis gravidarum is considered a diagnosis of exclusion.[11] HG can be associated with serious problems in the mother or baby, such as Wernicke\\'s encephalopathy, coagulopathy and peripheral neuropathy.[5]Women experiencing hyperemesis gravidarum often are dehydrated and lose weight despite efforts to eat.[23][24] The onset of the nausea and vomiting in hyperemesis gravidarum is typically before the 20th week of pregnancy.[11]Differential diagnosis[edit]Diagnoses to be ruled out include the following:[20]TypeDifferential diagnosesInfections(usually accompanied by fever or associated neurological symptoms)Urinary tract infectionHepatitisMeningitisGastroenteritisGastrointestinal disorders(usually accompanied by abdominal pain)AppendicitisCholecystitisPancreatitisFatty liverPeptic ulcerSmall bowel obstructionMetabolicThyrotoxicosis (common in Asian subcontinent)[5]Addison\\'s diseaseDiabetic ketoacidosisHyperparathyroidismDrugsAntibioticsIron supplementsGestational trophoblastic diseases (rule out with urine β-hCG)Molar pregnancyChoriocarcinomaInvestigations[edit]Common investigations include blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and electrolytes, liver function tests, urinalysis,[24] and thyroid function tests. Hematological investigations include hematocrit levels, which are usually raised in HG.[24] An ultrasound scan may be needed to know gestational status and to exclude molar or partial molar pregnancy.[25]Management[edit]Dry bland food and oral rehydration are first-line treatments.[26] Due to the potential for severe dehydration and other complications, HG is treated as an emergency. If conservative dietary measures fail, more extensive treatment such as the use of antiemetic medications and intravenous rehydration may be required. If oral nutrition is insufficient, intravenous nutritional support may be needed.[12] For women who require hospital admission, thromboembolic stockings or low-molecular-weight heparin may be used as measures to prevent the formation of a blood clot.[20]Intravenous fluids[edit]Intravenous (IV) hydration often includes supplementation of electrolytes as persistent vomiting frequently leads to a deficiency. Likewise, supplementation for lost thiamine (Vitamin B1) must be considered to reduce the risk of Wernicke\\'s encephalopathy.[27] A and B vitamins are depleted within two weeks, so extended malnutrition indicates a need for evaluation and supplementation. In addition, electrolyte levels should be monitored and supplemented; of particular concern are sodium and potassium.After IV rehydration is completed, patients typically begin to tolerate frequent small liquid or bland meals. After rehydration, treatment focuses on managing symptoms to allow normal intake of food. However, cycles of hydration and dehydration can occur, making continuing care necessary. Home care is available in the form of a peripherally-inserted central catheter (PICC) line for hydration and nutrition.[28]Home treatment is often less expensive and reduces the risk for a hospital-acquired infection compared with long-term or repeated hospitalizations.Medications[edit]A number of antiemetics are effective and safe in pregnancy including: pyridoxine/doxylamine, antihistamines (such as diphenhydramine), and phenothiazines (such as promethazine).[29] With respect to effectiveness, it is unknown if one is superior to another for relieving nausea or vomiting.[29] Limited evidence from published clinical trials suggests the use of medications to treat hyperemesis gravidarum.[30]While pyridoxine/doxylamine, a combination of vitamin B6 and doxylamine, is effective in nausea and vomiting of pregnancy,[31] some have questioned its effectiveness in HG.[32]Ondansetron may be beneficial, however, there are some concerns regarding an association with cleft palate,[33] and there is little high-quality data.[29] Metoclopramide is also used and relatively well tolerated.[34] Evidence for the use of corticosteroids is weak; there is some evidence that corticosteroid use in pregnant women may slightly increase the risk of cleft lip and cleft palate in the infant and may suppress fetal adrenal activity.[11][35] However, hydrocortisone and prednisolone are inactivated in the placenta and may be used in the treatment of hyperemesis gravidarum after 12 weeks.[11]Nutritional support[edit]Women not responding to IV rehydration and medication may require nutritional support. Patients might receive parenteral nutrition (intravenous feeding via a PICC line) or enteral nutrition (via a nasogastric tube or a nasojejunal tube). There is only limited evidence from trials to support the use of vitamin B6 to improve outcome.[30] An oversupply of nutrition (hyperalimentation) may be necessary in certain cases to help maintain volume requirements and allow weight gain.[25] A physician might also prescribe Vitamin B1 (to prevent Wernicke\\'s encephalopathy) and folic acid.[20]Alternative medicine[edit]Acupuncture (both with P6 and traditional method) has been found to be ineffective.[30] The use of ginger products may be helpful, but evidence of effectiveness is limited and inconsistent, though three recent studies support ginger over placebo.[30]While generally considered harmful, medical cannabis has been reported to be used in self-medication to treat pregnancy-associated hyperemesis.[36]Complications[edit]Pregnant woman[edit]If HG is inadequately treated, anemia,[11] hyponatremia,[11] Wernicke\\'s encephalopathy,[11] kidney failure, central pontine myelinolysis, coagulopathy, atrophy, Mallory-Weiss tears,[11] hypoglycemia, jaundice, malnutrition, pneumomediastinum, rhabdomyolysis, deconditioning, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, splenic avulsion, or vasospasms of cerebral arteries are possible consequences. Depression and post-traumatic stress disorder[37] are common secondary complications of HG and emotional support can be beneficial.[11]Infant[edit]The effects of HG on the fetus are mainly due to electrolyte imbalances caused by HG in the mother.[20] Infants of women with severe hyperemesis who gain less than 7 kilograms (15lb) during pregnancy tend to be of lower birth weight, small for gestational age, and born before 37 weeks gestation.[12] In contrast, infants of women with hyperemesis who have a pregnancy weight gain of more than 7kilograms appear similar to infants from uncomplicated pregnancies.[38] There is no significant difference in the neonatal death rate in infants born to mothers with HG compared to infants born to mothers who do not have HG.[11] Children born to mothers with undertreated HG have a fourfold increase in neurobehavioral diagnoses.[39]Epidemiology[edit]Vomiting is a common condition affecting about 50% of pregnant women, with another 25% having nausea.[40] However, the incidence of HG is only 0.3–1.5%.[5] After preterm labor, hyperemesis gravidarum is the second most common reason for hospital admission during the first half of pregnancy.[11] Factors, such as infection with Helicobacter pylori, a rise in thyroid hormone production, low age, low body mass index prior to pregnancy, multiple pregnancies, molar pregnancies, and a past history of hyperemesis gravidarum have been associated with the development of HG.[11]History[edit]Thalidomide was prescribed for treatment of HG in Europe until it was recognized that thalidomide is teratogenic and is a cause of phocomelia in neonates.[41]Etymology[edit]Hyperemesis gravidarum is from the Greek hyper-, meaning excessive, and emesis, meaning vomiting, and the Latin gravidarum, the feminine genitive plural form of an adjective, here used as a noun, meaning \"pregnant [woman]\". Therefore, hyperemesis gravidarum means \"excessive vomiting of pregnant women\".Notable cases[edit]Author Charlotte Brontë is often thought to have suffered from hyperemesis gravidarum. She died in 1855 while four months pregnant, having been afflicted by intractable nausea and vomiting throughout her pregnancy, and was unable to tolerate food or even water.[42]Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge was hospitalised due to hyperemesis gravidarum during her first pregnancy, and was treated for a similar condition during the subsequent two.[43][44]Comedienne Amy Schumer cancelled the remainder of a tour due to hyperemesis gravidarum.[45]References[edit]^ a b .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}\"Management of hyperemesis gravidarum\".

There was no antibody response to either tetanus or pneumococcal antigens. Flow cytometric studies showed normal levels of B, T, and NK cells, but B cells lacked CD19 (107265) and CD81 surface expression, and there were decreased numbers of memory B cells. Van Zelm et al.

The term was previously used for a paediatric syndrome but was redefined to include all ages.[1]FIRES was previously to refer to this syndrome in children aged three to fifteen years old. A healthy child that may have been ill in the last few days or with a lingering fever goes into a state of continuous seizures. The seizures are resistant to seizure medications and treatments, though barbiturates may be administered.[2]Medical diagnostic tests may initially return no clear diagnosis and may not detect any obvious swelling on the brain. The syndrome is very rare: it may only affect 1 in 1,000,000 children.[3]Contents1 Signs and symptoms2 EEG Findings3 Cause4 Diagnosis5 Treatment6 History7 References8 External linksSigns and symptoms[edit]FIRES starts with a febrile illness up to two weeks before seizure onset. These seizures damage the frontal lobe\\'s cognitive brain function such as memory and sensory abilities. This can result in learning disabilities,[2] behavioral disorders, memory issues, sensory changes, and possibly death. Children continue to have seizures throughout their lives.EEG Findings[edit]EEG findings suggest FIRES is a focal process with focal onset seizures. In a 2011 study of 77 FIRES patients, 58 had focal seizures. Of the 58, 50 had secondarily generalizing seizures (seizures that evolve from focal to generalized).[2][4] On a 10-20 scalp electrode EEG, the ictal activity commonly begins temporally and spreads hemispherically and/or bilaterally.[5] Interictally, patients may have slowing that may be considered an encephalopathic pattern.[6] A recent study of 12 FIRES patients demonstrated diffuse delta-theta background slowing interictally in all 12 cases.[7]Cause[edit]The cause of FIRES is not known.[8] There are some common clinical symptoms, such as onset after a nonspecific febrile illness, gastrointestinal illness, or upper respiratory infection. This prior illness is often cleared 1–14 days prior to the patient\\'s first seizures. There are theories of an immunological source, a genetic predisposition, and an inflammation-mediated process, but the definite cause is unknown. It is more common in boys more than girls.[9][10]Diagnosis[edit]FIRES is difficult to diagnose due to its rarity and lack of definitive biomarker. It is often diagnosed by ruling out other options such as infectious, toxic, metabolic, and genetic causes. FIRES will consist of two phases - acute and chronic. The acute phase consists of highly recurrent focal seizures, rapidly evolving into refractory status epilepticus. The chronic phase consists of drug-resistant epilepsy with cognitive impairment.[citation needed]Treatment[edit]Ketogenic diet is effective in some cases, with efficacy ranging from 16% to over 85%[2][11][12]Vagus nerve stimulation helps control seizure activity after recovery from status.Intravenous immunoglobulin treatment is being explored as an option to treat this form of epilepsy.[13]Barbiturates have been shown to be effective in treating status epilepsy.[14]History[edit]FIRES was named in 2008 by Dr. Andreas van Baalen and colleagues.[15] Previous names include AERRPS (acute encephalitis with refractory, repetitive partial seizures), DESC (Devastating Epilepsy in School-aged Children),[16] and NORSE (New-Onset Refractory Status Epilepticus).[16]References[edit]^ .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}Hirsch, LU; Gaspard, N; van Baalen, A; Nabbout, R; Demeret, S; Loddenkemper, T; Navarro, N; Specchio, N; Lagae, L; Rossetti, A; Hocker, S; Gofton, TE; Abend, NS; Gilmore, EJ; Hahn, C; Khosravani, H; Rosenow, F; Trinka, E (April 2018). \"Proposed consensus definitions for new‐onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE), febrile infection‐related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES), and related conditions\".

(2014) reported 2 unrelated patients, a 3-year-old girl (NLES8) and an 18-year-old man (NLES10), with EIEE59. The patients had onset of seizures within the first 3 months of life. The girl had multiple seizure types, whereas the male had infantile spasms that mostly resolved by age 5 months, although he had a few focal dyscognitive seizures and nonepileptic apneic spells later in life. Both patients had hypsarrhythmia on EEG. The girl had profound intellectual disability with no head control, inability to speak, and severe hypotonia, and she was fed by a G-tube. She reacted to music but not to people. The older patient had severe intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, no speech, mild ataxia, sleeping disorder, and automutilation behavior, and he could walk only with support.Hamdan et al. (2017) reported a 14-year-old boy (HSJ0048), born of unrelated French Canadian parents, who presented with severe developmental delay and onset of brief focal seizures at 11 months of age. The seizures sometimes progressed, and were controlled by medication. EEG showed modified hypsarrhythmia. Refractory seizures of variable types recurred at age 4.5 years. At age 14, he had severe intellectual disability with inability to sit on his own, absent language, poor eye contact, lack of interest in the environment, drooling, hypotonia, scoliosis, and bouts of aggression. Brain imaging showed enlarged ventricles.Molecular GeneticsIn 2 unrelated patients with EIEE59, the EuroEPINOMICS-RES Consortium et al. (2014) identified de novo heterozygous missense mutations in the GABBR2 gene (S695I, 607340.0004 and I705N, 607340.0005). The mutations were found by exome sequencing of a cohort of 356 trios in which the proband had early infantile epileptic encephalopathy. Functional studies of the variants and studies of patient cells were not performed, but the authors noted that GABBR2 is involved in synaptic transmission.In a 14-year-old boy (HSJ0048) with EIEE59, Hamdan et al. (2017) identified a de novo heterozygous missense mutation in the GABBR2 gene (G693W; 607340.0006). The mutation was found by whole-genome sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing; the patient was part of several cohorts of patients with developmental delay or epilepsy who underwent whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing. Functional studies of the variants and studies of patient cells were not performed, but the authors noted that GABBR2 is involved in synaptic inhibition.Using in vitro cellular transfection studies and animal models, Yoo et al. (2017) demonstrated that the GABBR2 S695I and I705N mutations, associated with EIEE59, reduced GABA signaling activity. Based on molecular modeling, the S695I and I705N mutations, located in transmembrane 6, were predicted to affect the structural integrity of the receptor.Animal ModelYoo et al. (2017) found that tadpoles injected with the EIEE59-associated GABBR2 mutations showed abnormal swimming patterns and increased frequencies of seizure-like behavior compared to wildtype. The variants could not rescue the defect in tadpoles with morpholino knockdown of the Gabbr2 gene, consistent with a loss of function. The addition of baclofen, a GABAB receptor agonist, to the water partially rescued the phenotype of animals, suggesting a potential therapeutic target in patients with GABBR2 mutations.INHERITANCE- Autosomal dominantHEAD & NECKHead- Poor head controlEyes- Poor visual contactMouth- DroolingSKELETALSpine- ScoliosisMUSCLE, SOFT TISSUES- HypotoniaNEUROLOGICCentral Nervous System- Epileptic encephalopathy- Seizures, multiple types- Developmental delay, profound- Intellectual disability- Absent speech- Inability to sit or stand- Inability to walk independently- Hypsarrhythmia- Sleep disturbances- Enlarged ventriclesBehavioral Psychiatric Manifestations- Aggressive outbursts- Self-injurious behaviorMISCELLANEOUS- Onset in early infancy- Seizures are usually refractory- De novo mutationMOLECULAR BASIS- Caused by mutation in the gamma-aminobutyric acid B receptor 2 gene (GABBR2,607340.0004)▲Close'},\n",

       "   'text': 'Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhoodSpecialtyENT surgeryBenign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood is an uncommon neurological disorder which presents with recurrent episodes of dizziness.[1] The presentation is usually between the ages of 2 years and 7 years of age and is characterised by short episodes of vertigo of sudden onset when the child appears distressed and unwell. The child may cling to something or someone for support. The episode lasts only minutes and resolves suddenly and completely. It is a self-limiting condition and usually resolves after about eighteen months, although many go on to experience migrainous vertigo (or vestibular migraine) when older.[citation needed]Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood is a migrainous phenomenon with more than 50% of those affected having a family history of migraines affecting a first-degree relative. It has no relationship to benign paroxysmal positional vertigo which is a different condition entirely.[citation needed]References[edit]^ .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}Batson, G (Jan 2004). \"Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood: A review of the literature\".

       "   'text': 'Jamaican vomiting sicknessSpecialtyToxicologyJamaican vomiting sickness (also known as toxic hypoglycemic syndrome (THS),[1] acute ackee fruit intoxication,[2] or ackee poisoning[1]) is an acute illness caused by the toxins hypoglycin A and hypoglycin B, which are present in fruit of the ackee tree.While in the fully ripened arils, hypoglycin A is at levels of less than 0.1 ppm, in unripe arils it can be over 1000 ppm;[3] and cause vomiting and even death. Some countries in the Caribbean and Western Africa experience frequent cases.[4]Contents1 Presentation2 Pathophysiology3 Diagnosis4 In popular culture5 ReferencesPresentation[edit]Abdominal discomfort begins two to six hours after eating unripe ackee fruit, followed by sudden onset vomiting. In severe cases, profound dehydration, seizures, coma, and death may ensue.Children and those who are malnourished are more susceptible to the disease.[3]Pathophysiology[edit]When ingested, hypoglycin A is metabolized to produce methylenecyclopropylacetic acid (MCPA). MCPA acts to inhibit the beta-oxidation of fatty acids in two ways.First, it interferes with the transport of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria.Also, it inhibits acyl-CoA dehydrogenases, so that only unsaturated fatty acids can be fully oxidized.Fatty acids accumulate in the liver in a microvesicular pattern that can be seen on biopsy. In the absence of fatty acid metabolism, the body becomes dependent on glucose and glycogen for energy. Octreotide can be used to reduce secretion of insulin by the pancreas, thereby preventing severe hypoglycemia.[3]Inhibition of beta-oxidation of fatty acids, however, also depletes a necessary cofactor for gluconeogenesis.Once the liver glycogen stores are depleted, the body cannot synthesize glucose, and severe hypoglycemia results.[3]A similar outbreak of lethal hypoglycemic encephalopathy has been linked to consumption of lychee fruit in Muzaffarpur, India. Urinalysis of children affected by the disease has shown all affected have elevated levels of hypoglycin suggesting the same underlying pathophysiology as Jamaican vomiting sickness.[5]Diagnosis[edit]This section is empty.

       "   'text': 'A number sign (#) is used with this entry because of evidence that early infantile epileptic encephalopathy-46 (EIEE46) is caused by heterozygous mutation in the GRIN2D gene (602717) on chromosome 19q13.For a general phenotypic description and a discussion of genetic heterogeneity of EIEE, see EIEE1 (308350).Clinical FeaturesLi et al. (2016) reported 2 unrelated girls with severely delayed global development and onset of intractable seizures at 4 and 2 months of age, respectively. In the 8.5-year-old proband, EEG showed multifocal spike wave discharges, with hypsarrhythmia. She was seizure-free between about 3 and 5 years of age on levetiracetam; when this treatment was discontinued, seizures recurred with status epilepticus. She had very slow developmental progress with poor walking and few words. Other features included failure to thrive, poor feeding, dysphagia, constipation, mild cortical visual impairment, axial hypotonia, appendicular hypertonia, and minor dysmorphic features such as deep-set eyes, thick eyebrows, long eyelashes, tented upper lip, full cheeks, and widely spaced teeth. The other patient was a 2.7-year-old Tunisian girl with microcephaly, axial and orofacial hypotonia, and appendicular hypertonia who was unable to sit unassisted, speak words, or grasp objects. She had uncoordinated movements and was nondysmorphic except for severe pes planus.Tsuchida et al. (2018) reported 3 unrelated patients with EIEE46. The patients presented in the first months or years of life with global developmental delay and intractable seizures of various types. EEG showed multifocal discharges and diffuse spike and slow wave complexes. Additional variable features included jerky limb movements, hypotonia, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, ADHD, and autism. One patient could sit and roll over, but could not speak at age 8 years (Enjoji scale, less than 10). Another was able to walk and speak, but had impaired intellectual development (verbal IQ of 57, performance IQ of 68, and full-scale IQ of 58) at 15 years of age. The third patient, who was 8 years old, had no developmental progress beyond infancy and was unable to control his head, speak, or have eye contact. Brain imaging was normal in the first 2 patients; the third patient had loss of white matter volume, dilated ventricles, thin corpus callosum, and cerebral atrophy.Clinical ManagementAfter Li et al. (2016) identified a mutation in the GRIN2D gene in 2 girls with early infantile encephalopathy and obtained in vitro data, they treated both patients with various NMDAR antagonists, including memantine and ketamine, as well as magnesium, which causes voltage-dependent inhibition. The older girl was treated with memantine at age 6.5 years, with variable response and no sustained improvement. She was eventually treated with ketamine and magnesium, which resulted in better seizure control. The younger girl was started on memantine at age 2.5 years, which resulted in better seizure control and some developmental improvement.Molecular GeneticsIn 2 unrelated girls with EIEE46, Li et al. (2016) identified a de novo heterozygous missense mutation in the GRIN2D gene (V667I; 602717.0001). The mutation was found by whole-exome sequencing in the first patient and by sequencing of a targeted epilepsy gene panel in the second patient. The mutation occurred at a highly conserved residue in the M3 transmembrane domain that forms the ion channel core. Voltage clamp studies in transfected Xenopus oocytes and HEK293 cells showed that the mutation increased the receptor responsiveness to glutamate and glycine agonists, decreased the sensitivity of the channel to negative allosteric modulators, prolonged the deactivation time, and increased the channel opening probability, all consistent with a gain-of-function effect on the NMDA receptor. Transfection of the mutation into rat cortical neurons showed that it resulted in increased neuronal excitotoxicity that could be blocked by the NMDAR antagonist memantine.In 3 unrelated patients with EIEE46, Tsuchida et al. (2018) identified heterozygous missense mutations in the GRIN2D gene (602717.0002-602717.0004).

One such family has been reported.Clinical FeaturesSaunders et al. (2015) reported a 7-year-old girl, born of unrelated parents, with a mitochondrial myopathy. She had normal early development, with the exception of toe-walking, but began to show severe progressive proximal muscle weakness resulting in loss of ambulation by age 3 years. Independent sitting became difficult due to fatigue. Her fine motor skills declined, speech became dysarthric, and hypotonicity progressed to spasticity. Other features included complex partial seizures, lactic acidosis, and increased serum pyruvate. Skeletal muscle biopsy showed abnormal mitochondria with disarray of cristae and dense globular osmiophilic inclusions on electron microscopy. Ragged-red fibers were not observed, but there was an increase in secondary lysosomes containing residual bodies that appeared to be derived from mitochondria. Mitochondrial oxidative enzyme analysis was normal, suggesting normal function of the electron transport chain. The patient's cognitive function was difficult to assess due to seizures and oromotor dystonia, but she attended elementary school.InheritanceThe transmission pattern of MMLA in the family reported by Saunders et al. (2015) was consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance.Molecular GeneticsIn a girl with MMLA, Saunders et al. (2015) identified compound heterozygous truncating mutations in the PNPLA8 gene (612123.0001-612123.0002). The mutations, which were found by exome sequencing, were predicted to result in a loss of function, and Western blot analysis of patient muscle biopsy showed a dramatic decrease in immunoreactivity for the PNPLA8 protein. Saunders et al. (2015) noted that the phenotype in this patient replicated that of the Pnpla8-null mouse (Mancuso et al., 2009).Animal ModelMancuso et al. (2009) found abundant expression of the Pnpla8 gene in multiple regions of the mouse brain, including the cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, and brainstem. Pnpla8-null mice showed a neurodegenerative disorder phenotype characterized by impaired spatial learning and memory. There were morphologic alterations in the hippocampus, including enlarged mitochondria, heteromorphic membrane structures, and inclusion bodies containing sheets and whorls of membranes that were identified as degenerating mitochondria. Analysis of lipid extracts from the hippocampus of mutant mice showed increased cardiolipin content and altered molecular species distribution, consistent with altered mitochondrial phospholipid homeostasis.HistoryHackett et al. (1973) described 2 sisters with signs of growth failure, severe muscle weakness, and moderate neural deafness. Light microscopy of skeletal muscle showed areas of 'granular necrosis,' which, by electron microscopy, were found to be produced by large and numerous mitochondria. Hyperalaninemia and hyperalaninuria were demonstrated, and an oral alanine load was more slowly cleared than normal. The patients also had elevated pyruvate concentration in the blood and severe lactic acidosis, which in 1 girl was fatal at age 11 years. The girls were asymptomatic until ages 6 and 8 years. One sister was alive at age 20.

       "   'text': \"Citrullinemia type 1 is an inherited disorder that causes ammonia and other toxic substances to accumulate in the blood. There are four types. The classic, most severe form, occurs in newborns, while a milder, later-onset form occurs in children or adults. There's also a form that occurs during or after pregnancy, and a form with no symptoms. In the classic form, symptoms occur right after birth and include excessive sleepiness, poor appetite, vomiting, and irritability. As ammonia builds up, muscle weakness, seizures, coma, and death can occur. Citrullinemia is caused by mutations in the ASS1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.  This disorder is diagnosed through newborn screening and additional medical and genetic tests. Treatment includes removal of ammonia in the blood by medications and dialysis, as well as a lifelong low-protein diet. Liver transplantation is possible and, if done early in life, may eliminate the symptoms of the disorder. Left untreated, people with citrullinemia will build up very high levels of ammonia in the blood that can lead to brain damage and eventually death. Treated individuals can have normal growth and development.\"},\n",

They had an extremely severe phenotype, with onset of multiple seizure types in the first week of life followed by profound developmental impairment without detectable regression. One of the patients was a 17-year-old girl with quadriparesis, nephrocalcinosis, delayed dentition, severe growth failure with microcephaly, hirsutism, kyphoscoliosis, joint contractures, and tapering fingers. Brain imaging showed extreme supratentorial atrophy with absence of myelination of the cerebrum and thin corpus callosum; the cerebellum was unaffected. The other patient was a 6-year-old girl with hypotonia and profound intellectual disability. Brain imaging showed delayed myelination, thin corpus callosum, and frontal atrophy. EEG in both patients showed multifocal abnormal activity.The EPI4K Consortium (2016) noted that the EPI4K Consortium and Epilepsy Phenome/Genome Project (2013) had reported a patient with EIEE41. The EPI4K Consortium (2016) summarized the clinical features of this patient, an 8-year-old girl. She had onset of mainly myoclonic seizures at age 1 month. There was some developmental regression after onset of seizures, and she had severe intellectual disability. Other features included blindness, hypotonia with head lag, and mild spasticity. EEG showed disorganized background activity, frequent discharges, and hypsarrhythmia; brain imaging was normal.Guella et al. (2017) reported 2 unrelated boys with EIEE41. Both presented with focal motor seizures and twitching in the first weeks of life, followed by severely delayed psychomotor development. Each had episodes of developmental regression. One had cortical visual impairment, feeding difficulties with G-tube placement, a hyperkinetic movement disorder, lack of speech, and inability to sit unsupported. The other had refractory seizures, hypotonia, inability to fix or follow, no head control, G-tube, and tracheostomy. Brain imaging in both patients showed cerebral atrophy and delayed myelination.Molecular GeneticsIn 2 unrelated patients with EIEE41, the Epi4K Consortium (2016) identified 2 different de novo heterozygous missense mutations in the SLC1A2 gene (G82R, 600300.0001 and L85P, 600300.0002). The mutations were found by targeted sequencing of 27 candidate genes in 531 patients with a similar disorder. Functional studies of the variants and studies of patient cells were not performed. The same de novo heterozygous G82R mutation had previously been identified in another patient with EIEE by the Epi4K Consortium and Epilepsy Phenome/Genome Project (2013), which included 264 probands with epileptic encephalopathy who underwent exome sequencing.In 2 unrelated patients with EIEE41, Guella et al. (2017) identified de novo heterozygous missense mutations in the SLC1A2 gene (600300.0003 and 600300.0004). The first patient was identified from a cohort of 42 individuals with epileptic encephalopathy who underwent sequencing of candidate genes; the second patient was identified through collaboration with clinical and research databases.

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.(July 2020) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)Symptoms generally begin around puberty but can occur earlier. These individuals have recurrent swelling in the extremities, genitals, face, lips, larynx or GI tract. Some patients describe a sensation of fullness but not pain or itching in the affected area except for those with abdominal swellings who often experience acute abdominal pain. Others experience an intense amount of pain, described as radiating from the bone outward along with intense itching just beneath the skin and intense heat, regardless of the area targeted.Instances of swelling around the throat or larynx can cause difficulties in breathing should the swelling obstruct airways. This has been known to cause a large number of fatalities in those afflicted with the disorder. Episodes that attack the gastrointestinal tract can cause a number of complications including dehydration from being unable to keep anything down (which, depending on length of the episode, can prove fatal). Symptoms from GI tract swelling including violent vomiting, intense pain from the midsection, dehydration, and intense exhaustion.Some sufferers of HAE experience \\'wandering\\' attacks. These attacks will center around an extremity. For example: Should the sufferer\\'s hand swell up, it will go through the normal swelling cycle before \\'transferring\\' to either the connection limb (In this case wrist to forearm) or move to the opposite hand. Sufferers with this symptom may find their episodes last longer and may find their triggers more difficult to track.Pathogenesis[edit]Because HAE is an autosomal dominant disease, there is no sex difference in transmission and both sexes are equally likely to receive the mutated gene from their parents. In an example, a father (individual A) with a mutated gene for HAE, has the disease while his wife (individual B) with 2 non-mutated copies of the C1 inhibitor gene and does not have the disease. The possibility of a cross between them gives the possibilities as shown: two of their offspring will have the disease (HEA) while the others would not.[6][7]The affected father who has HAE has a mutation on one of his genes (C1-INH). Each one of his children, regardless of sex, will have a 50% chance to inherit the mutated C1-INH gene from him. HAE is generally referred to as a \"dominant\" condition because it only takes a mutation in one of the two C1-INH genes in a carrier to cause the disease.[8][9]The prevalence of HAE is relatively low – between 1 in every 10,000 to 1 in every 50,000 persons. Most persons with HAE acquire a C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) mutation from one of their parents. A parent with HAE usually has a 50% probability of transmitting this condition on to one of his/her children of either sex as shown in the figure (HEA Inheritance). People with no previous history of can acquire HAE by spontaneous changes in the sperm or egg cell. In a review of patients who do not have a history of HAE in their family, but who have relatively low levels of mutated C1-INH with persistent angioedema, 25% of new patients who had HAE had C1-INH changes that do not show signs of inheritance.Diagnosis[edit]Complement testsC4 (C)FB (A)C3CH50Conditions· ↓↓↓PSG, C3 NeF AA↓· ↓· HAE, C4D· · · ↓TCPD↓· /↓↓↓SLE↑↑↑↑inflammationRecognizing HAE is often difficult due to the wide variability in disease expression. The course of the disease is diverse and unpredictable, even within a single patient over their lifetime. This disease may be similar in its presentation to other forms of angioedema resulting from allergies or other medical conditions, but it is significantly different in cause and treatment. When HAE is misdiagnosed as an allergy it is most commonly treated with steroids and epinephrine, drugs that are usually ineffective in treating a HAE episode. Other misdiagnoses have resulted in unnecessary exploratory surgery for patients with abdominal swelling and other HAE patients report that their abdominal pain was wrongly diagnosed as psychosomatic.HAE accounts for only a small fraction of all cases of angioedema. To avoid potentially fatal consequences such as upper airway obstruction and unnecessary abdominal surgery, the importance of a correct diagnosis cannot be over-emphasized.[10]HAE should be considered if a patient presents with:Recurrent angioedema (without urticaria)Recurrent episodes of abdominal pain and vomitingLaryngeal edemaPositive family history of angioedema[11][12]A blood test, ideally taken during an episode, can be used to diagnose the condition. Measure: serum complement factor 4 (C4),C1 inhibitor (C1-INH) antigenic protein, C1 inhibitor (C1-INH) functional level if available. Analysis of complement C1 inhibitor levels may play a role in diagnosis. C4 and C2 are complementary components.Types[edit]There are three types of C1 inhibitor deficiency:[13]HAE type I is primarily caused by a deficiency in blood proteins (C1 esterase inhibitors) which normally suppress activation of the complement system. The resultant over-stimulation of this system leads to the production of inflammatory anaphylatoxins, which affects the flow of body fluids between the vascular system and body tissues. This deficiency is responsible for approximately 80–85% of cases.HAE type II is a less frequently encountered form of this disorder and accounts for 15–20% of cases. In this type, atypical C1-inhibitor proteins are produced which are less capable of suppressing activation of the complement system. Like HAE type I, this results in over-stimulation of this system.HAE type III is rare and has only been documented recently. Unlike types I and II, this form does not appear to be connected with C1-inhibitor deficiency. This type mainly affects females and appears to be influenced by contact with estrogens and also by hormone replacement therapy (e.g. oral contraceptives). Its pathogenesis is credited to increased activity of the enzyme kininogenase, which leads to rise in the levels of bradykinin. Other patients with type III HAE have alterations in gene F12, which encodes a protein which participates in blood coagulation.[14] Some patients with type III HAE have a mutation in the F12 gene which produces a protein involved in blood clotting.[15] Due to the results of a genetic test on 4 affected German families, it is believed that this type of the condition is caused by a disease-causing gene in chromosome 5q.35.2-q35.3.[16]Prevention[edit]Treatment with ACE inhibitors is contraindicated in this condition, as these drugs can lead to bradykinin accumulation, which can precipitate disease episodes.[17][18]Long-term[edit]People in whom episodes occur at least once a month or who are at high risk of developing laryngeal edema require long-term prevention. There are several phase III clinical trials addressing HAE prophylaxis and therapy. These have led to the licensing of pdC1INH in many parts of the world; bradykinin receptor antagonists (icatibant) in Europe; kallikrein inhibitors (ecallantide and lanadelumab) in the United States; and recombinant C1-INH replacement therapy (rhC1INH; conestat alfa) in Europe. Tranexamic acid has been shown to be relatively ineffective therapy. Danazol prophylaxis remains an option but therapeutic agents are now being used more for prophylaxis because of danazol\\'s adverse events.[19] For people requiring long-term prophylaxis, home therapy which allows people to self-administer the product, is considered an integral part of allowing patients a normal quality of life.In 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved lanadelumab, an injectable monoclonal antibody, to prevent attacks of HAE types I and II in patients over age 12. Lanadelumab inhibits the plasma enzyme kallikrein, which liberates the kinins bradykinin and kallidin from their kininogen precursors and is produced in excess in individuals with HAE types I and II.[20][21]Berotralstat was approved in the United States in December 2020, for the prevention of attacks of hereditary angioedema in people over twelve years of age.[22][23]Short-term[edit]Short-term prevention is normally administered before surgery or dental treatment. In Germany, C1-INH concentrate is used for this and given 1–1.5 hours before the procedure. In countries where C1-inhibitor concentrate is not available or only available in an emergency (laryngeal edema), high-dose androgen treatment is administered for 5–7 days.Management[edit]The aim of acute treatment is to halt progression of the edema as quickly as possible, which can be life-saving, particularly if the swelling is in the larynx. In Germany, most acute treatment consists of C1 inhibitor concentrate from donor blood, which must be administered intravenously; however, in most European countries, C1 inhibitor concentrate is only available to patients who are participating in special programs. In emergency situations where C1 inhibitor concentrate is not available, fresh frozen plasma (FFP) can be used as an alternative, as it also contains C1 inhibitor.Other treatment modalities can stimulate the synthesis of C1 inhibitor, or reduce C1 inhibitor consumption. Purified C1 inhibitor, derived from human blood, has been used in Europe since 1979. Several C1 inhibitor treatments are now available in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and two C1 inhibitor products are now available in Canada. Berinert P (CSL Behring), which is pasteurized, was approved by the F.D.A. in 2009 for acute attacks. Cinryze (ViroPharma), which is nanofiltered, was approved by the F.D.A. in 2008 for prophylaxis. Ruconest (Pharming) is a recombinant C1 inhibitor approved in the US and Europe that does not carry the risk of infectious disease transmission due to human blood-borne pathogens.[24]The medication ecallantide inhibits plasma kallikrein and was approved by the F.D.A. (but not in Europe) for acute attacks in 2009. Icatibant inhibits the bradykinin B2 receptor, and was approved in Europe and the USA.[24][25]In HAE, specific stimuli that have previously led to attacks may need to be avoided in the future. It does not respond to antihistamines, corticosteroids, or epinephrine.Prognosis[edit]About 25% of those affected die in the first two decades of life, mainly due to lack of treatment.[26]Epidemiology[edit]Data regarding the epidemiology of angioedema is limited. The incidence of HAE is one in 10,000–50,000 people in the United States and Canada. Mortality rates are estimated at 15–33%, resulting primarily from laryngeal edema and asphyxiation. HAE leads to 15,000–30,000 emergency department visits per year.[27][28]Society and culture[edit]There are national associations for HAE patients and their families in a number of countries around the world. These national associations are members of the global organization HAEi - International Patient Organization for C1-Inhibitor Deficiencies. HAEi is dedicated to raising awareness of C1 inhibitor deficiencies around the world. It is a non-profit international network established to promote co-operation, co-ordination and information sharing between HAE specialists and national HAE patient associations in order to help facilitate the availability of effective diagnosis and management of C1 inhibitor deficiencies throughout the world.[29]The Assistance Fund Inc. is an American nonprofit organization that offers co-pay assistance for medications that treat HAE and is open to any American Citizens or landed immigrants who have insurance.Lisa Sanders once described a case in her column in New York times about hereditary angioedema mystery case caused by contraceptive pills [30]Research[edit]Clinical development of several new active substances, which intervene in the disease process in different ways, is currently ongoing.Pharming Group NV announced on 24 June 2010 that the European Medicines Agency has adopted a positive opinion on conestat alfa (trade name Ruconest), a C1-inhibitor for the treatment of acute angioedema attacks.[31]Ecallantide, a peptide inhibitor of kallikrein, has received orphan status for HAE and has shown positive results in phase III trials.[32]Icatibant (marketed as Firazyr) is a selective bradykinin receptor antagonist, which has been approved in Europe and was approved in the US by the FDA in Aug 2011.[33] After initial borderline results this drug was shown to be effective in phase III trials.[34] Cinryze has been approved by the FDA in October 2008.[35]References[edit]^ a b c d e f g h i .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}\"Hereditary angioedema\".

Typically, it resolves in days to months.[6] It, however, may recur in some people.[7]The first medical description of the condition occurred in 1921 by Róbert Bárány.[10] Approximately 2.4% of people are affected at some point in time.[1] Among those who live until their 80s, 10% have been affected.[2] BPPV affects females twice as often as males.[7] Onset is typically in people between the ages of 50 and 70.[2].mw-parser-output .toclimit-2 .toclevel-1 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-3 .toclevel-2 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-4 .toclevel-3 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-5 .toclevel-4 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-6 .toclevel-5 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-7 .toclevel-6 ul{display:none}Contents1 Signs and symptoms2 Cause3 Mechanism4 Diagnosis4.1 Differential diagnosis5 Treatment5.1 Repositioning maneuvers5.1.1 Epley maneuver5.1.2 Semont maneuver5.1.3 Brandt–Daroff exercises5.1.4 Roll maneuver5.2 Medications5.3 Surgery6 References7 Further reading8 External linksSigns and symptoms[edit]This section needs additional citations for verification.

Many are also capable of describing the exact head movements that provoke their vertigo. Purely horizontal nystagmus and symptoms of vertigo lasting more than one minute can also indicate BPPV occurring in the horizontal semicircular canal.The spinning sensation experienced from BPPV is usually triggered by movement of the head, will have a sudden onset, and can last anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes. The most common movements people report triggering a spinning sensation are tilting their heads upward in order to look at something and when rolling over in bed.[11]People with BPPV do not experience other neurological deficits such as numbness or weakness. If those symptoms are present, a more serious etiology, such as posterior circulation stroke or ischemia, must be considered.Cause[edit]Within the labyrinth of the inner ear lie collections of calcium crystals known as otoconia or otoliths. In people with BPPV, the otoconia are dislodged from their usual position within the utricle, and over time, migrate into one of the semicircular canals (the posterior canal is most commonly affected due to its anatomical position). When the head is reoriented relative to gravity, the gravity-dependent movement of the heavier otoconial debris (colloquially \"ear rocks\") within the affected semicircular canal causes abnormal (pathological) endolymph fluid displacement and a resultant sensation of vertigo. This more common condition is known as canalithiasis.In rare cases, the crystals themselves can adhere to a semicircular canal cupula, rendering it heavier than the surrounding endolymph. Upon reorientation of the head relative to gravity, the cupula is weighted down by the dense particles, thereby inducing an immediate and sustained excitation of semicircular canal afferent nerves. This condition is termed cupulolithiasis.There is evidence in the dental literature that malleting of an osteotome during closed sinus floor elevation, otherwise known as osteotome sinus elevation or lift, transmits percussive and vibratory forces capable of detaching otoliths from their normal location and thereby leading to the symptoms of BPPV.[12][13]BPPV can be triggered by any action that stimulates the posterior semi-circular canal including:Looking up or downFollowing head injurySudden head movementRolling over in bedTilting the headBPPV may be made worse by any number of modifiers which may vary among individuals:Changes in barometric pressure – people may feel increased symptoms up to two days before rain or snowLack of sleep (required amounts of sleep may vary widely)StressAn episode of BPPV may be triggered by dehydration, such as that caused by diarrhea. For this reason, it commonly occurs in people with post-operative diarrhea induced by post-operative antibiotics.BPPV is one of the most common vestibular disorders in people presenting with dizziness; a migraine is implicated in idiopathic cases. Proposed mechanisms linking the two are genetic factors and vascular damage to the labyrinth.[14]Although BPPV can occur at any age, it is most often seen in people older than the age of 60.[15] Besides aging, there are no major risk factors known for BPPV, although previous episodes of head trauma, or the inner ear infection labyrinthitis, may predispose to the future development of BPPV.[11]Mechanism[edit]The inside of the ear is composed of an organ called the vestibular labyrinth. The vestibular labyrinth includes semicircular canals, which contain fluids and fine hairlike sensors that act as a monitor to the rotations of the head. An important structure in the inner ear includes the otolith organs that contain crystals that are sensitive to gravity. These crystals are responsible for sensitivity to head positions, and can also be dislocated, causing them to lodge inside one of the semicircular canals, which causes dizziness.[citation needed]Diagnosis[edit]The condition is diagnosed by the person\\'s history, and by performing the Dix–Hallpike test or the roll test, or both.[16][17]The Dix–Hallpike test is a common test performed by examiners to determine whether the posterior semicircular canal is involved.[17] It involves a reorientation of the head to align the posterior semicircular canal (at its entrance to the ampulla) with the direction of gravity. This test will reproduce vertigo and nystagmus characteristic of posterior canal BPPV.[16]When performing the Dix–Hallpike test, people are lowered quickly to a supine position, with the neck extended by the person performing the maneuver. For some people, this maneuver may not be indicated, and a modification may be needed that also targets the posterior semicircular canal. Such people include those who are too anxious about eliciting the uncomfortable symptoms of vertigo, and those who may not have the range of motion necessary to comfortably be in a supine position. The modification involves the person moving from a seated position to side-lying without their head extending off the examination table, such as with Dix–Hallpike. The head is rotated 45 degrees away from the side being tested, and the eyes are examined for nystagmus. A positive test is indicated by the patient report of a reproduction of vertigo and clinician observation of nystagmus. Both the Dix–Hallpike and the side-lying testing position have yielded similar results, and as such the side-lying position can be used if the Dix–Hallpike cannot be performed easily.[18]The roll test can determine whether the horizontal semicircular canal is involved.[16] The roll test requires the person to be in a supine position with their head in 30° of cervical flexion. Then the examiner quickly rotates the head 90° to the left side, and checks for vertigo and nystagmus. This is followed by gently bringing the head back to the starting position. The examiner then quickly rotates the head 90° to the right side and checks again for vertigo and nystagmus.[16] In this roll test, the person may experience vertigo and nystagmus on both sides, but rotating toward the affected side will trigger a more intense vertigo. Similarly, when the head is rotated toward the affected side, the nystagmus will beat toward the ground and be more intense.[17]As mentioned above, both the Dix–Hallpike and roll test provoke the signs and symptoms in subjects suffering from archetypal BPPV. The signs and symptoms people with BPPV experience are typically a short-lived vertigo and observed nystagmus. In some people, although rarely, vertigo can persist for years. Assessment of BPPV is best done by a medical health professional skilled in the management of dizziness disorders, commonly a physiotherapist, audiologist, or other physician.The nystagmus associated with BPPV has several important characteristics that differentiate it from other types of nystagmus.Latency of onset: there is a 5–10 second delay prior to onset of nystagmusNystagmus lasts for 5–60 secondsPositional: the nystagmus occurs only in certain positionsRepeated stimulation, including via Dix–Hallpike maneuvers, cause the nystagmus to fatigue or disappear temporarilyRotatory/Torsional component is present, or (in the case of lateral canal involvement) the nystagmus beats in either a geotropic (toward the ground) or ageotropic (away from the ground) fashionVisual fixation suppresses nystagmus due to BPPVAlthough rare, CNS disorders can sometimes present as BPPV. A practitioner should be aware that if a person whose symptoms are consistent with BPPV, but does not show improvement or resolution after undergoing different particle repositioning maneuvers — detailed in the Treatment section below — need to have a detailed neurological assessment and imaging performed to help identify the pathological condition.[1]Differential diagnosis[edit]Vertigo, a distinct process sometimes confused with the broader term, dizziness, accounts for about six million clinic visits in the United States every year; between 17 and 42% of these people are eventually diagnosed with BPPV.[1] Other causes of vertigo include:Motion sickness/motion intolerance: a disjunction between visual stimulation, vestibular stimulation, and/or proprioceptionVisual exposure to nearby moving objects (examples of optokinetic stimuli include passing cars and falling snow)Other diseases: (labyrinthitis, Ménière\\'s disease, and migraine,[19] etc.)Treatment[edit]Repositioning maneuvers[edit]A number of maneuvers have been found to be effective including: the Epley maneuver, the Semont maneuver, and to a lesser degree Brandt–Daroff exercises.[5] Both the Epley and the Semont maneuvers are equally effective.[5][20]Epley maneuver[edit]Main article: Epley maneuverThe Epley maneuver employs gravity to move the calcium crystal build-up that causes the condition.[21] This maneuver can be performed during a clinic visit by health professionals, or taught to people to perform at home, or both.[22] Postural restriction after the Epley maneuver increases its effect somewhat.[23]When practiced at home, the Epley maneuver is more effective than the Semont maneuver. The most effective repositioning treatment for posterior canal BPPV is the therapist-performed Epley combined with home-practiced Epley maneuvers.[24] Devices such as the DizzyFIX can help users conduct the Epley maneuver at home, and are available for the treatment of BPPV.[25]The Epley maneuver does not address the presence of the particles (otoconia); rather it changes their location. The maneuver aims to move these particles from some locations in the inner ear that cause symptoms such as vertigo, and reposition them to where they do not cause these problems.Semont maneuver[edit]Main article: Semont maneuverThe Semont maneuver has a cure rate of 90.3%.[26] It is performed as follows:The person is seated on a treatment table with their legs hanging off the side of the table. The therapist then turns the person\\'s head 45 degrees toward the unaffected side.The therapist then quickly tilts the person so they are lying on the affected side. The head position is maintained, so their head is turned up 45 degrees. This position is maintained for 3 minutes. The purpose is to allow the debris to move to the apex of the ear canal.The person is then quickly moved so they are lying on the unaffected side with their head in the same position (now facing downward 45 degrees). This position is also held for 3 minutes. The purpose of this position is to allow the debris to move toward the exit of the ear canal.Finally, the person is slowly brought back to an upright seated position. The debris should then fall into the utricle of the canal and the symptoms of vertigo should decrease or end completely.Some people will only need one treatment, but others may need multiple treatments, depending on the severity of their BPPV. In the Semont maneuver, as with the Epley maneuver, people are able to achieve canalith repositioning by themselves.[22]Brandt–Daroff exercises[edit]The Brandt–Daroff exercises may be prescribed by the clinician as a home treatment method, usually in conjunction with particle-repositioning maneuvers or in lieu of the particle-repositioning maneuver. The exercise is a form of habituation exercise, designed to allow the person to become accustomed to the position that causes the vertigo symptoms. The Brandt–Daroff exercises are performed in a similar fashion to the Semont maneuver; however, as the person rolls onto the unaffected side, the head is rotated toward the affected side.[27] The exercise is typically performed 3 times a day with 5–10 repetitions each time, until symptoms of vertigo have resolved for at least 2 days.[16]Roll maneuver[edit]For the lateral (horizontal) canal, a separate maneuver has been used for productive results. It is unusual for the lateral canal to respond to the canalith repositioning procedure used for the posterior canal BPPV. Treatment is therefore geared toward moving the canalith from the lateral canal into the vestibule.[28]The roll maneuver or its variations are used, and involve rolling the person 360 degrees in a series of steps to reposition the particles.[1][29] This maneuver is generally performed by a trained clinician who begins seated at the head of the examination table with the person supine[30] There are four stages, each a minute apart, and at the third position the horizontal canal is oriented in a vertical position with the person\\'s neck flexed and on forearm and elbows.[30] When all four stages are completed, the head roll test is repeated, and if negative, treatment ceases.[30]Medications[edit]Medical treatment with anti-vertigo medications may be considered in acute, severe exacerbation of BPPV, but in most cases are not indicated. These primarily include drugs of the antihistamine and anticholinergic class, such as meclizine[8] and hyoscine butylbromide (scopolamine), respectively. The medical management of vestibular syndromes has become increasingly popular over the last decade, and numerous novel drug therapies (including existing drugs with new indications) have emerged for the treatment of vertigo/dizziness syndromes. These drugs vary considerably in their mechanisms of action, with many of them being receptor- or ion channel-specific. Among them are betahistine or dexamethasone/gentamicin for the treatment of Ménière\\'s disease, carbamazepine/oxcarbazepine for the treatment of paroxysmal dysarthria and ataxia in multiple sclerosis, metoprolol/topiramate or valproic acid/tricyclic antidepressant for the treatment of vestibular migraine, and 4-aminopyridine for the treatment of episodic ataxia type 2 and both downbeat and upbeat nystagmus.[31] These drug therapies offer symptomatic treatment, and do not affect the disease process or resolution rate. Medications may be used to suppress symptoms during the positioning maneuvers if the person\\'s symptoms are severe and intolerable. More dose-specific studies are required, however, in order to determine the most effective drug(s) for both acute symptom relief and long-term remission of the condition.[31]Surgery[edit]Surgical treatments, such as a semi-circular canal occlusion, exist for severe and persistent cases that fail vestibular rehabilitation (including particle repositioning and habituation therapy). As they carry the same risks as any neurosurgical procedure, they are reserved as last resorts.References[edit]^ a b c d e f g h i j k l .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}Bhattacharyya N, Baugh RF, Orvidas L, Barrs D, Bronston LJ, Cass S, Chalian AA, Desmond AL, Earll JM, Fife TD, Fuller DC, Judge JO, Mann NR, Rosenfeld RM, Schuring LT, Steiner RW, Whitney SL, Haidari J (November 2008). \"Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo\".

       "   'text': \"A number sign (#) is used with this entry because of evidence that cyclic vomiting syndrome can be caused by mutation in the mitochondrial transfer RNA-leucine gene (MTTL1; 590050).Clinical FeaturesCyclic vomiting syndrome has long been recognized (Lombard, 1861; Gee, 1882). It is characterized by recurrent, explosive bouts of vomiting punctuated by periods of normal health. Affected individuals have stereotypical episodes with rapid onset, most often during the night or in the early morning, a high peak frequency of vomiting every 10 to 15 minutes, associated with nausea, retching, abdominal pain, lethargy, anorexia, pallor, and a rapid complete resolution. Median age at onset is 5 years, and median age at resolution of symptoms is 10 years (Haan et al., 2002).In a review of 214 children with cyclic vomiting syndrome, Li et al. (1999) found that 176 (82%) met the criteria for migraine-related CVS, having either a family history of migraine or subsequent development of migraine, and 38 (18%) did not. Comparison of clinical features between the 2 groups showed that those without associated migraine had more severe episodes than those with migraine. Patients with associated migraine had more symptoms of abdominal pain, headache, social withdrawal, photophobia, and triggering events. Patients with associated migraine showed a significantly better response to antimigraine therapy than those without migraine. Li et al. (1999) concluded that cyclic vomiting syndrome is related to migraine in the vast majority of cases.Haan et al. (2002) reported a family in which 4 members spanning 3 generations had cyclic vomiting syndrome. Age at onset was 13 to 15 years, slightly later than is typical for cyclic vomiting syndrome. Accompanying features were variable, and included increased yawning, diarrhea, diaphoresis, and photophobia, but no headache. Three women and 1 man were affected. The maternal inheritance suggested a mitochondrial disorder, but extensive metabolic studies of the proband showed no abnormalities.Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome PlusA subset of patients with cyclic vomiting syndrome have coexisting neuromuscular disorders, including cognitive delay, myopathy, or seizure disorders. Boles et al. (2003) referred to this subset as 'cyclic vomiting syndrome-plus.' They found that 48 (86%) of 57 families demonstrated probable or possible maternal inheritance. Non-CVS manifestations included growth retardation (59%), GI dysmotility (71%), exercise intolerance (45%), migraine headaches (40%), vital sign fluctuations (30%), endocrinopathies (25%), and psychiatric disorders (25%). Boles et al. (2003) postulated a maternally inherited propensity towards dysautonomia, of which CVS is only one of several potential clinical manifestations.InheritanceBoles et al. (2005) provided further clinical evidence for maternal inheritance in both isolated CVS and CVS-plus. Clinical interviews with 80 unrelated patients, including 44 individuals with isolated CVS and 23 with CVS-plus, and their families showed that disease manifestations were far more common in matrilineal compared to nonmatrilineal relatives. In both groups, affected matrilineal relatives had high incidences of dysautonomic-related conditions, including migraine and irritable bowel syndrome, as well as depression and hypothyroidism. Maternal inheritance was suggested in 54% and 52% of individuals with isolated CVS and CVS-plus, respectively.Molecular GeneticsIn 4 members of an Italian family with cyclic vomiting syndrome, Salpietro et al. (2003) identified a mutation in the MTTL1 gene (590050.0001). The youngest affected member, a 5-year-old boy, had 70% mutant mtDNA in peripheral blood. The boy's mother, maternal aunt, and maternal grandmother, who were all affected, had 35%, 30%, and 25% mutant mtDNA, respectively. There was a positive correlation between amount of mutant mtDNA and clinical severity. The 3 adults were affected by the syndrome during childhood and developed migraine headaches as adults.INHERITANCE- Mitochondrial- MultifactorialGROWTHOther- Growth retardationHEAD & NECKHead- Microcephaly (in patients with 'CVS-plus,' CVS+)Ears- Hearing loss (CVS+)Eyes- Strabismus (CVS+)CARDIOVASCULARHeart- Cardiomyopathy (CVS+)ABDOMENGastrointestinal- Abdominal pain- Nausea- Anorexia- Gastrointestinal dysmotility (CVS+)SKIN, NAILS, & HAIRSkin- PallorMUSCLE, SOFT TISSUES- Hypotonia (CVS+)- Muscle weakness (CVS+)- Delayed motor development (CVS+)- Exercise intolerance (CVS+)NEUROLOGICCentral Nervous System- Vomiting, episodic- Rapid onset- Occurs most often during the night or early morning- Peak frequency of vomiting every 10 to 15 minutes- Lethargy- Rapid complete resolution of symptoms- Interictal periods of normal health- Migraine headaches (CVS+)- Cognitive impairment (CVS+)- Mental retardation (CVS+)- Seizures (CVS+)- Ataxia (CVS+)Behavioral Psychiatric Manifestations- Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (CVS+)- Autism (CVS+)- Pervasive developmental disorder (CVS+)MISCELLANEOUS- Mean age at onset 5 years- Mean age at resolution of symptoms 10 years- Cyclic vomiting syndrome plus (CVS+) is characterized by additional neuromuscular and/or visceral organ manifestations (as indicated above)MOLECULAR BASIS- Caused by mutation in the mitochondrial transfer RNA-leucine gene (MTTL1, 590050.0001)▲Close\"},\n",

       "   'text': 'A number sign (#) is used with this entry because of evidence that congenital secretory sodium diarrhea (DIAR8) is caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutation in the NHE3 gene (SLC9A3; 182307) on chromosome 5p15.For discussion of genetic heterogeneity of diarrhea, see DIAR1 (214700).Clinical FeaturesHolmberg and Perheentupa (1985) described a 9-year-old Finnish girl with congenital diarrhea that seemed to be caused by a specific defect in intestinal sodium absorption. The pregnancy was complicated by maternal polyhydramnios, and in the delivery room the patient had a distended abdomen and passed a voluminous watery stool, indicative of intrauterine onset of the diarrhea. Stool analysis showed an abnormally high chloride level, but an even higher sodium concentration. Administration of standard solutions used to treat congenital chloride diarrhea (CCD; see 214700) resulted in metabolic acidosis and vomiting, with an electrolyte status clearly different than that seen in infants with CCD. She improved after treatment with an alkalinizing sodium and potassium citrate solution, and had normal growth and development despite persistent watery diarrhea of more than 1 liter per day that did not cease on fasting. X-rays of the stomach and intestines were normal except for slight dilation of the ileal loops.Janecke et al. (2015) reported 9 patients from 8 families with secretory sodium diarrhea. There was maternal polyhydramnios in all pregnancies, and all patients had watery secretory diarrhea and prominent abdominal distention after birth due to dilated fluid-filled loops of intestine, indicating that secretory diarrhea had begun prenatally. None of the patients exhibited syndromic features. Inflammatory bowel disease developed in 2 patients, with onset at 4 years of age in 1 patient, resulting in ileocecal resection and temporary ileostomy due to recurrent episodes of small bowel obstruction. The second patient presented at age 16 years with bloody diarrhea and ulceration in the rectum and sigmoid; 1 year later he had nodular lymphoid hyperplasia with ileal granulomas and colonic ulcers, and he passed 3 to 4 watery stools per day without bleeding. Intestinal anatomy, histology, and transit functions were normal in the other patients.Molecular GeneticsIn 2 unrelated patients with congenital sodium diarrhea (CSD), 1 of whom was a 37-year-old Finnish woman who had been originally studied by Holmberg and Perheentupa (1985), Janecke et al. (2015) performed whole-exome sequencing and identified compound heterozygosity for mutations in the SLC9A3 gene (see 182307.0001-182307.0004). In a 2.5-year-old Canadian girl with CSD, chromosomal microarray analysis revealed compound heterozygosity for a 1.383-Mb deletion on chromosome 5p15.33 that encompassed the SLC9A3 gene, and a missense mutation in SLC9A3 (R382Q; 182307.0003). The same R382Q missense mutation was identified in an apparently unrelated 1.5-year-old Canadian boy, in compound heterozygosity with a 1-bp deletion (182307.0004). Another 5 mutations were identified in 5 probands, including a homozygous missense mutation (A269T; 182307.0005) in 2 affected sibs. In 1 patient, a rare mechanism of recessive disease was revealed: the patient was homozygous for a frameshift mutation (182307.0006) inherited from her heterozygous mother, and SNP array analysis revealed maternal isodisomy of the entire chromosome 5 in the patient. None of the mutations was found in public databases, and segregation with disease was confirmed in 6 of the families by sequencing of DNA samples from available family members. Janecke et al.

       "   'title': 'Familial hemiplegic migraine',\n",
       "   'text': 'Familial hemiplegic migraine is a form of migraine headache that runs in families. Migraines usually cause intense, throbbing pain in one area of the head, often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and extreme sensitivity to light and sound. These recurrent headaches typically begin in childhood or adolescence and can be triggered by certain foods, emotional stress, and minor head trauma. Each headache may last from a few hours to a few days.In some types of migraine, including familial hemiplegic migraine, a pattern of neurological symptoms called an aura precedes the headache. The most common symptoms associated with an aura are temporary visual changes such as blind spots (scotomas), flashing lights, zig-zagging lines, and double vision. In people with familial hemiplegic migraine, auras are also characterized by temporary numbness or weakness, often affecting one side of the body (hemiparesis). Additional features of an aura can include difficulty with speech, confusion, and drowsiness. An aura typically develops gradually over a few minutes and lasts about an hour.Unusually severe migraine episodes have been reported in some people with familial hemiplegic migraine. These episodes have included fever, seizures, prolonged weakness, coma, and, rarely, death. Although most people with familial hemiplegic migraine recover completely between episodes, neurological symptoms such as memory loss and problems with attention can last for weeks or months. About 20 percent of people with this condition develop mild but permanent difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia), which may worsen with time, and rapid, involuntary eye movements called nystagmus.FrequencyThe worldwide prevalence of familial hemiplegic migraine is unknown. Studies suggest that in Denmark about 1 in 10,000 people have hemiplegic migraine and that the condition occurs equally in families with multiple affected individuals (familial hemiplegic migraine) and in individuals with no family history of the condition (sporadic hemiplegic migraine). Like other forms of migraine, familial hemiplegic migraine affects females more often than males.CausesMutations in the CACNA1A, ATP1A2, SCN1A, and PRRT2 genes have been found to cause familial hemiplegic migraine. The first three genes provide instructions for making proteins that are involved in the transport of charged atoms (ions) across cell membranes. The movement of these ions is critical for normal signaling between nerve cells (neurons) in the brain and other parts of the nervous system. The function of the protein produced from the PRRT2 gene is unknown, although studies suggest it interacts with a protein that helps control signaling between neurons.Communication between neurons depends on chemicals called neurotransmitters, which are released from one neuron and taken up by neighboring neurons. Researchers believe that mutations in the CACNA1A, ATP1A2, and SCN1A genes can upset the balance of ions in neurons, which disrupts the normal release and uptake of certain neurotransmitters in the brain. Although the mechanism is unknown, researchers speculate that mutations in the PRRT2 gene, which reduce the amount of PRRT2 protein, also disrupt normal control of neurotransmitter release. The resulting changes in signaling between neurons lead people with familial hemiplegic migraine to develop these severe headaches.There is little evidence that mutations in the CACNA1A, ATP1A2, SCN1A, and PRRT2 genes play a role in common migraines, which affect millions of people each year. Researchers are searching for additional genetic changes that may underlie rare types of migraine, such as familial hemiplegic migraine, as well as the more common forms of migraine.Learn more about the genes associated with Familial hemiplegic migraineATP1A2CACNA1APRRT2SCN1AInheritance PatternThis condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most cases, affected individuals have one affected parent. However, some people who inherit an altered gene never develop features of familial hemiplegic migraine. (This situation is known as reduced penetrance.) A related condition, sporadic hemiplegic migraine, has identical signs and symptoms but occurs in individuals with no history of the disorder in their family.'},\n",

       "   'title': 'Acute necrotizing encephalopathy type 1',\n",
       "   'text': 'Acute necrotizing encephalopathy type 1, also known as susceptibility to infection-induced acute encephalopathy 3 or IIAE3, is a rare type of brain disease (encephalopathy) that occurs following a viral infection such as the flu.Acute necrotizing encephalopathy type 1 typically appears in infancy or early childhood, although some people do not develop the condition until adolescence or adulthood. People with this condition usually show typical symptoms of an infection, such as fever, cough, congestion, vomiting, and diarrhea, for a few days. Following these flu-like symptoms, affected individuals develop neurological problems, such as seizures, hallucinations, difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia), or abnormal muscle tone. Eventually, most affected individuals go into a coma, which usually lasts for a number of weeks. The condition is described as \"acute\" because the episodes of illness are time-limited.People with acute necrotizing encephalopathy type 1 develop areas of damage (lesions) in certain regions of the brain. As the condition progresses, these brain regions develop swelling (edema), bleeding (hemorrhage), and then tissue death (necrosis). The progressive brain damage and tissue loss results in encephalopathy.Approximately one-third of individuals with acute necrotizing encephalopathy type 1 do not survive their illness and subsequent neurological decline. Of those who do survive, about half have permanent brain damage due to tissue necrosis, resulting in impairments in walking, speech, and other basic functions. Over time, many of these skills may be regained, but the loss of brain tissue is permanent. Other individuals who survive their illness appear to recover completely.It is estimated that half of individuals with acute necrotizing encephalopathy type 1 are susceptible to recurrent episodes and will have another infection that results in neurological decline; some people may have numerous episodes throughout their lives. Neurological function worsens following each episode as more brain tissue is damaged.FrequencyAcute necrotizing encephalopathy type 1 is likely a very rare condition, although its incidence is unknown. At least 59 cases of this condition have been reported in the scientific literature.CausesMutations in the RANBP2 gene have been found to increase the risk of developing acute necrotizing encephalopathy type 1. The RANBP2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that interacts with a protein complex known as the nuclear pore. The nuclear pore is a channel that allows transport of molecules in and out of the cell\\'s nucleus. The RANBP2 protein helps regulate the transport of proteins and other molecules through the nuclear pore and helps modify proteins coming into or out of the nucleus. In addition to its functions at the nuclear pore, the RANBP2 protein also plays multiple roles during cell division and helps transport materials within cells.RANBP2 gene mutations that are associated with acute necrotizing encephalopathy type 1 result in the production of a protein that cannot function normally either due to altered shape or because it cannot get to the nuclear pore where it is needed. These mutations do not cause health problems on their own; it is unclear how they are involved in the process by which a viral infection triggers neurological problems. Researchers suspect that prolonged inflammation in response to the infection may be involved in the development of acute necrotizing encephalopathy type 1, although the role of the altered RANBP2 protein in this process is unknown. Inflammation is a normal immune system response to injury and foreign invaders (such as viruses). However, excessive inflammation can damage the body\\'s tissues. Additionally, certain inflammatory proteins can be toxic to nerve cells when present in large amounts. It is suspected that the combination of the altered RANBP2 protein and the abnormal immune response play a role in individuals\\' susceptibility to recurrent episodes of acute necrotizing encephalopathy type 1. In people with acute necrotizing encephalopathy type 1, the virus is not found in nerve cells in the brain or spinal cord (central nervous system), so it is likely that the immune reaction, rather than the infection itself, accounts for the neurological signs and symptoms.Influenza is the most common virus found in people with acute necrotizing encephalopathy type 1; other viruses that are known to trigger this condition include human herpesvirus 6, coxsackie virus, and enteroviruses. In rare cases, the bacterium Mycoplasma pneumoniae is involved. Because the signs and symptoms of acute necrotizing encephalopathy type 1 do not vary significantly among the different infections, it is likely that the type of infection is less important than the occurrence of an infection to trigger the condition.Some people with signs and symptoms of acute necrotizing encephalopathy type 1 do not have an identified mutation in the RANBP2 gene. In these cases, the gene involved is unknown.Learn more about the gene associated with Acute necrotizing encephalopathy type 1RANBP2Inheritance PatternAcute necrotizing encephalopathy type 1 is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase the risk of developing the disorder following an infection.In most cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from a parent. Other cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.Some people who have the altered RANBP2 gene never develop the condition, a situation known as reduced penetrance. It is estimated that an individual with a RANBP2 gene mutation has a 40 percent chance of developing acute necrotizing encephalopathy type 1 during his or her lifetime. Additional genetic or environmental factors likely play a role in whether an infection triggers the signs and symptoms of this condition. The health history of the individual, such as nutritional status and number of prior infections, may also influence risk.'},\n",

       "   'text': 'EpidemicThe Tanganyika laughter epidemic of 1962 was an outbreak of mass hysteria– or mass psychogenic illness (MPI)– rumored to have occurred in or near the village of Kashasha on the western coast of Lake Victoria in Tanganyika (which, once united with Zanzibar, became the modern nation of Tanzania) near the border with Uganda.[1]Contents1 History2 Causes3 See also4 References5 External linksHistory[edit]The laughter epidemic began on January 30, 1962, at a mission-run boarding school for girls in Kashasha. It started with three girls and spread throughout the school, affecting 95 of the 159 pupils, aged 12–18.[2][3] Symptoms lasted from a few hours to 16 days. The teaching staff were unaffected and reported that students were unable to concentrate on their lessons. The school closed on March 18.[4]The epidemic spread to Nshamba, a village where several of the girls lived.[4] In April and May, 217 mostly young villagers had laughing attacks. The Kashasha school reopened on May 21, and reclosed at the end of June. Earlier that month, the laughing epidemic spread to Ramashenye girls\\' middle school, near Bukoba, affecting 48 girls.[2]The Kashasha school was sued for allowing the children and their parents to transmit it to the surrounding area. Other schools, Kashasha itself, and another village were affected to some degree.[4] Eighteen months after it started, the phenomenon died off. The laughter reports were widely accompanied by descriptions of fainting, flatulence, respiratory problems, rashes, crying and screaming.[5]In all, 14 schools were shut down and 1000 people were affected.[6]Causes[edit]Christian F. Hempelmann, then of Purdue University, has theorized that the episode was stress-induced.In 1962, Tanganyika had just won its independence, he said,and students had reported feeling stressed because of higher expectations by teachers and parents.MPI, he says, usually occurs in people without a lot of power.\"MPI is a last resort for people of a low status.It\\'s an easy way for them to express that something is wrong.\"[5][7]Sociologist Robert Bartholomew and psychiatrist Simon Wessely both put forward a culture-specific epidemic hysteria hypothesis, pointing out that the occurrences in 1960s Africa were prevalent in missionary schools and Tanganyikan society was ruled by strict traditional elders, so the likelihood is the hysteria was a manifestation of the cultural dissonance between the “traditional conservatism” at home and the new ideas challenging those beliefs in school, which they termed ‘conversion reactions’.[8]See also[edit]List of mass hysteria casesDancing maniaReferences[edit]^ .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}Jeffries, Stuart (November 21, 2007). \"The outbreak of hysteria that\\'s no fun at all\".

(2009) reported an 18-year-old girl with a mental retardation syndrome resembling Pitt-Hopkins syndrome (PTHS; 610954). She had normal growth parameters but severe mental retardation, acquired walking at age 2 years, and showed developmental regression after the first years. She also had hyperbreathing and autistic behavior. Seizures were not present, and brain MRI was normal. Other features included decreased reflexes in the upper extremities, constipation, and mild facial dysmorphism, including broad mouth, strabismus, and protruding tongue with drooling.Harrison et al. (2011) reported 2 sisters, born of unrelated Caucasian parents, with a severe mental retardation syndrome characterized by onset of epileptic encephalopathy at age 4 and 6 months, respectively, with loss of early developmental skills. Both had hypotonia and poor feeding in early infancy. The older sister began to walk with a wide-based unsteady gait at age 5 years, whereas the younger sister never learned to walk. At age 16 years, the older sister had a complex seizure disorder with drop attacks, tonic-clonic seizures, atypical absences, and myoclonic jerks. Development was very slow, with occasional episodes of regression associated with an increase of seizures. She had very limited speech and several behavioral abnormalities, including self-harm and repetitive movements. At age 11 years, the younger sister had severe myoclonic epilepsy with occasional atypical absences, and slow developmental progress without episodes of regression. The older sister had episodes of hyperventilation, and the younger had breath-holding spells. Other features in both girls included an abnormal sleep-wake cycle, stereotyped behavior, gastroesophageal reflux with poor growth, constipation, early-onset puberty, pulmonary stenosis, and scoliosis.

       "   'text': 'Abortion in Paraguay is illegal except in case of the threat to the life of the woman.[1] Anyone who performs an abortion can be sentenced to 15 to 30 months in prison. If the abortion is done without the consent of the woman, the punishment is increased to 2 to 5 years. If the death of the woman occurred as a result of the abortion, the person who did the procedure can be sentenced to 4 to 6 years in prison, and 5 to 10 years in cases in which she did not consent.[1]In Paraguay, 23 out of 100 deaths of young women are the result of illegal abortions.[2] Concerning this death rate, Paraguay has one of the highest in the region.[2]In April 2015, a story about a 10-year-old Paraguayan girl who was 22 weeks pregnant as a result of having allegedly been raped and impregnated by her stepfather came to light.[3] The pregnancy had been discovered that same month upon the girl’s mother having brought her to a local hospital in order to receive medical treatment for abdominal pain, which was found to have been related to the pregnancy. Calls from her mother as well as outraged members of the public throughout the world for permission to allow the girl the ability to undergo an abortion procedure were ultimately denied. The girl had given birth to the child via a caesarean section in a Red Cross hospital in Paraguay’s capital city of Asunción later that year.[3] The girl’s stepfather has since been prosecuted for the rape and her mother had also been charged with negligence for her alleged role in the circumstances surrounding the rape and pregnancy of her daughter. The high-profile nature of this case has led opposition leftist parties to push for less restrictive abortion laws in Paraguay, such as in cases of child pregnancies and in cases of sexual assault.[3] The United Nations has found that the maternal death rate is four times higher for girls under the age of 16 in Latin America.[3] The 10-year-old girl has reportedly survived the birth, and her mother and grandmother have both requested legal custody of the newborn child.[3]See also[edit]AbortionAbortion by countryAbortion lawDomestic violence in ParaguayHealth in ParaguayWomen in ParaguayReferences[edit]^ a b https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/abortion/doc/paraguay.doc^ a b .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}\"Archived copy\".

       "   'text': 'A number sign (#) is used with this entry because of evidence that episodic ataxia type 6 (EA6) is caused by heterozygous mutation in the SLC1A3 gene (600111) on chromosome 5p13.For a general phenotypic description and discussion of genetic heterogeneity of episodic ataxia, see EA1 (160120).Clinical FeaturesJen et al. (2005) reported a 10-year-old boy with a severe form of episodic ataxia with seizures, migraine, and alternating hemiplegia. From birth, he had experienced 4 discrete episodes of ataxia and slurred speech, seemingly triggered by febrile illness. At age 6 years, he developed a severe right-sided headache followed by hemiparesis and decreased consciousness lasting 5 days. MRI showed cerebellar atrophy, and neurologic examination showed mild interictal truncal ataxia.De Vries et al. (2009) reported a Dutch family in which 3 individuals had episodic ataxia. The phenotype was milder than that described by Jen et al. (2005). Onset was in the first or second decade. Episodic attacks lasted 2 to 3 hours and were often associated with nausea, vomiting, photophobia, phonophobia, vertigo, diplopia, and/or slurred speech. Headaches were not a prominent feature. Attacks were provoked by emotional stress, fatigue, or consumption of alcohol or caffeine. The 35-year-old proband noted that truncal and gait ataxia during the attacks became more prominent with age. The proband had interictal horizontal gaze-evoked nystagmus without gait or truncal ataxia. All patients showed a favorable response to treatment with acetazolamide.Clinical VariabilityPyle et al. (2015) reported 2 first cousins with autosomal dominant ataxia associated with a heterozygous missense mutation in the SLC1A3 gene (R454Q; 600111.0003). Both patients presented in their thirties with speech disturbances and later developed cerebellar ataxia, jerky ocular pursuits, and dysarthria. One had hypometric saccades and dysphagia, whereas the other had urinary urgency and frequency. The disorder was not described as episodic, thus expanding the phenotype associated with SLC1A3 mutations. The patients were part of a cohort of 35 patients from 22 families with ataxia who underwent exome sequencing.

Cellular studies showed that the mutation resulted in markedly decreased glutamate uptake. Jen et al.

Functional expression studies showed that the mutation resulted in an 18% decrease in glutamate uptake, which was not as severe as that observed with the mutation reported by Jen et al. (2005). De Vries et al. (2009) concluded that EA6 symptoms were correlated with the extent of glutamate transporter dysfunction.INHERITANCE- Autosomal dominantHEAD & NECKEars- Vertigo, episodic- Phonophobia, episodicEyes- Diplopia, episodic- Photophobia, episodic- Nystagmus (in some patients)- Hypometric saccades (in some patients)- Jerky ocular pursuit (in some patients)ABDOMENGastrointestinal- Nausea- VomitingMUSCLE, SOFT TISSUES- Hypotonia, episodicNEUROLOGICCentral Nervous System- Delayed motor development- Cerebellar ataxia, episodic- Hemiplegia, episodic- Seizures (rare)- Dysarthria- Migraine- Cerebellar hypoplasia, mild (in 1 patient)MISCELLANEOUS- Three unrelated families have been reported (last curated November 2016)- Onset in infancy or childhood- Later onset has been reported- Episodes may last several hours- Episodes triggered by fever, illness, feeding, stress, exercise- Variable phenotype and severity- Favorable response to treatment with acetazolamideMOLECULAR BASIS- Caused by mutation in the solute carrier family 1 (glial high affinity glutamate transporter), member 3 gene (SLC1A3,600111.0001)▲Close'},\n",

One such patient has been reported.Clinical FeaturesBelkaya et al. (2019) reported an 11-year-old girl, born of consanguineous Algerian parents, who developed fatal fulminant hepatitis upon acute infection with hepatitis A. The patient presented with fatigue, nausea, hepatomegaly, jaundice, decreased appetite, incoherent speech, and gingival bleeding, which rapidly progressed to coma, icterus, and liver failure. Liver enzymes were significantly increased, and she underwent liver transplantation, but died a day later of multiorgan failure. She had no previous chronic or acute liver disease, and her 2 brothers experienced benign hepatitis A infections. However, she had a history of autoimmune disease, including insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus with anti-islet cell and anti-insulin antibodies, Hashimoto thyroiditis with antithyroperoxidase antibodies, and antithyroglobulin antibodies. She was also seropositive for CMV and EBV. She had no other features of an immunodeficiency.InheritanceThe transmission pattern of FVH in the family reported by Belkaya et al. (2019) was consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance.Molecular GeneticsIn an 11-year-old girl, born of consanguineous Algerian parents, with FVH, Belkaya et al. (2019) identified a homozygous 40-bp deletion in the IL18BP gene (604113.0001), resulting in splicing abnormalities and complete IL18BP deficiency. The mutation, which was found by whole-exome sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing, segregated with the disorder in the family. In vitro functional expression studies showed that the abnormal transcripts resulting from the mutation were unable to block any IL18 activity compared to wildtype or missense variants. Patient liver tissue showed high IL18 levels, barely detectable IL18BP, and high levels of inflammatory cells. Additional in vitro cellular studies showed that in the wildtype state, IL18-activated NK cells killed both infected and uninfected hepatocytes, and that this cytotoxicity was reversed by the addition of IL18BP. The findings indicated that absence of IL18BP in the patient with fulminant viral hepatitis due to hepatitis A led to uncontrolled IL18-mediated cytotoxic activity and an activated host response against hepatocytes.'},\n",

HaNDL syndrome is most often diagnosed in adulthood, although individuals with ages ranging from 7 to 52 have been reported with this condition. The most common neurological symptoms associated with HanDL syndrome include: weakness on one side of the body (hemiparesis), a feeling of altered sensation down one side of the body (hemisensory disturbances), and a loss of the ability to understand or express speech (aphasia). These symptoms usually last between 15 minutes and 2 hours. The cause of HaNDL syndrome is not well understood; however, researchers have suggested a few potential causes, including migraines, inflammation of the tissue that lines the brain and spinal cord, and viral infections.

It is an important cause of traveler\\'s diarrhea, chronic abdominal pain, chronic fatigue,[citation needed] and failure to thrive in children.Contents1 Signs and symptoms2 Cause2.1 Genetic diversity2.2 Transmission3 Diagnosis4 Treatment5 Epidemiology6 History7 See also8 References9 External linksSigns and symptoms[edit]The most commonly reported symptoms in conjunction with infection with D. fragilis include abdominal pain (69%) and diarrhea (61%).[1] Diarrhea may be intermittent and may not be present in all cases. It is often chronic, lasting over two weeks. The degree of symptoms may vary from asymptomatic to severe,[2] and can include weight loss, vomiting, fever, and involvement of other digestive organs.Symptoms may be more severe in children. Additional symptoms reported have included:[3]Weight lossFatigueNausea and vomitingFeverUrticaria (skin rash)Pruritus (itchiness)Biliary infectionCause[edit]Genetic diversity[edit]As many individuals are asymptomatic carriers of D. fragilis,pathogenic and nonpathogenic variants are proposed to exist. A study of D. fragilis isolates from 60 individuals with symptomatic infection in Sydney, Australia, found all were infected with the same genotype,[4] which is the most common worldwide, but differed from the genotype first described from a North American isolate and later also detected in Europe.[5]Transmission[edit]Organisms similar to D. fragilis are known to produce a cyst stage that is able to survive outside the host and facilitate infection of new hosts. However, the exact manner in which it is transmitted is not yet known, as the organism is unable to survive outside its human host for more than a few hours after excretion, and no cyst stage has been found.[6]Early theories of transmission suggestedD. fragilis was unable to produce a cyst stage in infected humans, but some animal existed that in which it did produce a cyst stage, and this animal was responsible for spreading it. However, no such animal has ever been discovered.[3] A later theory suggested the organism was transmitted by pinworms, which provided protection for the parasite outside the host. DNA has been detected in surface-sterilized eggs of Enterobius vermicularis eggs, thus suggesting the latter may harbor the former.[7] Experimental ingestion ofpinworm eggs established infection in two investigators. Numerous studies reported high rates of coinfection with helminthes.[8] However, recent study has failed to show any association between D. fragilis infection and pinworm infection. Parasites similar to D. fragilis are transmitted by consuming water or food contaminated with feces.[6] The high rate (40%) of concomitant infection with other protozoa reported by at St. Vincent\\'s Hospital, Sydney, Australia, supports the oral-fecal route of transmission.Diagnosis[edit]Diagnosis is usually performed by submitting multiple stool samples for examination by a parasitologist in a procedure known as an ova and parasite examination. About 30% of children with D. fragilis infection exhibit peripheral blood eosinophilia.[citation needed]A minimum of three stool specimens having been immediately fixed in polyvinyl alcohol fixative, sodium acetate-acetic acid-formalin fixative, or Schaudinn\\'s fixative should be submitted, as the protozoan does not remain morphologically identifiable for long. All specimens, regardless of consistency, are permanently stained prior to microscopic examination with an oil immersion lens. The disease may remain cryptic due to the lack of a cyst stage if these recommendations are not followed.[9]The trophozoite forms have been recovered from formed stool, thus the need to perform the ova and parasite examination on specimens other than liquid or soft stools. DNA fragment analysis provides excellent sensitivity and specificity when compared to microscopy for the detection of D. fragilis and both methods should be employed in laboratories with PCR capability. The most sensitive detection method is parasite culture, and the culture medium requires the addition of rice starch.An indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) for fixed stool specimens has been developed.One researcher investigated the phenomenon of symptomatic relapse following treatment of infection with D. fragilis in association with its apparent disappearance from stool samples. The organism could still be detected in patients through colonoscopy or by examining stool samples taken in conjunction with a saline laxative.[10]A study found that trichrome staining, a traditional method for identification, had a sensitivity of 36% (9/25) when compared to stool culture.[11]An additional study found that the sensitivity of staining was 50% (2/4), and that the organism could be successfully cultured in stool specimens up to 12-hours old that were kept at room temperature.[12]Treatment[edit]Concomitant pinworm infection should also be excluded, although the association has not been proven.Successful treatment of the infection with iodoquinol, doxycycline, metronidazole, paromomycin, and secnidazole has been reported.[3][2] Resistance requires the use of combination therapy to eradicate the organism. All persons living in the same residence should be screened for D. fragilis, as asymptomatic carriers may provide a source of repeated infection. Paromomycin is an effective prophylactic for travellers who will encounter poor sanitation and unsafe drinking water.[citation needed]Epidemiology[edit]Rates of infection increase in conditions of crowding and poor sanitation, and are higher in military personnel and mental institutions.The true extent of disease has yet to emerge, as most laboratories do not use techniques to adequately identify this organism. An Australian study identified a large number of patients, considered to have irritable bowel syndrome, who were actually infected with Dientamoeba fragilis.[13]Although D. fragilis has been described as an infection \"emerging from obscurity\",[3] it has become one of the most prevalent gastrointestinal infections in industrialized countries, especially among children and young adults. A Canadian study reported a prevalence of around 10% in boys and girls aged 11–15 years,[6] a prevalence of 11.5% in individuals aged 16–20, and a lower incidence of 0.3–1.9% in individuals over age 20.History[edit]Early microbiologists reported that the organism was not pathogenic,though six of the seven individuals from whom they isolated it were experiencing symptoms of dysentery. Their report, published in 1918, concluded the organism was not pathogenic because it consumed bacteria in culture, but did not appear to engulf red blood cells, as was seen in the best-known disease-causing amoeba of the time, Entamoeba histolytica. This initial report may still be contributing to the reluctance of physicians to diagnose the infection.[3]See also[edit]List of parasites (human)References[edit]^ .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}Vandenberg O, Peek R, Souayah H,etal.

The reduced peak of NAA found on spectroscopy indicates neuronal degeneration, and impaired formation of myelin can result from neuronal dysfunction. In response, Kucinski et al. (2009) agreed that the primary defect in this condition is in the gray matter, and suggested that abnormal neuronal metabolism could result in disrupted crosstalk between neurons and oligodendrocytes, and defective myelination. However, neuronal dysfunction was not as apparent as the lack of normal myelin development in the imaging data.Falk et al. (2014) reported 2 sibs, born of consanguineous Indian parents, with EIEE39. The proband was a 6.7-year-old girl who had onset of focal and generalized seizures at 10 months of age, followed by delayed psychomotor development and profound mental retardation with absent speech, inability to sit or walk, profound hypotonia, and inability to follow commands. Brain imaging showed delayed myelination and cerebral volume loss. MR spectroscopy showed decreased NAA and increased choline and lactate. Extensive metabolic work-up and muscle biopsy did not show any etiology. Her brother presented with seizures at age 10 months and a similar neurologic disorder as his sister.InheritanceThe transmission pattern of EIEE39 in the family reported by Falk et al. (2014) was consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance.Molecular GeneticsIn a Swedish girl with global cerebral hypomyelination and severe psychomotor retardation, Wibom et al. (2009) identified a homozygous mutation in the SLC25A12 gene (603667.0001). In vitro functional expression studies showed impaired protein activity. Wibom et al. (2009) postulated that the disease pathogenesis did not result from impaired neuronal energy production, but rather from reduced mitochondrial aspartate efflux, which is necessary for NAA and myelin formation.In 2 sibs, born of consanguineous Indian parents, with EIEE39, Falk et al. (2014) identified a homozygous missense mutation in the SLC25A12 gene (R353Q; 603667.0002). The mutation, which was found by whole-exome sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing, segregated with the disorder in the family. In vitro functional expression studies in E. coli showed that the mutant protein had about 15% residual activity. Falk et al. (2014) suggested that the brain myelination defect in these patients stems primarily from neuronal loss attributable to the energy deficit caused by a lack of cellular reducing equivalents generated by the glutamate-aspartate shuttle, and that the brain insult may be compounded by a lack of neuronal-generated NAA that is required for myelin synthesis.Animal ModelJalil et al. (2005) found that Slc25a12-null mice had no detectable malate-aspartate shuttle activity in skeletal muscle and brain mitochondria. Mutant mice showed retarded growth, generalized tremor, pronounced motor coordination defects, and decreased survival. Analysis of the central nervous system showed impaired myelination without a change in neuron number. Analysis of lipid components showed a marked decrease in the myelin lipid galactosyl cerebroside. Brain content of the myelin lipid precursor, N-acetylaspartate, and that of aspartate were drastically decreased. The findings showed that aralar plays an important role in myelin formation by providing aspartate for the synthesis of N-acetylaspartate in neuronal cells.INHERITANCE- Autosomal recessiveHEAD & NECKEyes- Poor eye contactRESPIRATORY- Apneic spellsMUSCLE, SOFT TISSUES- Hypotonia, severeNEUROLOGICCentral Nervous System- Epileptic encephalopathy- Delayed psychomotor development, profound- Crawling and standing not achieved- Lack of speech- Seizures- Hypotonia, severe- Spasticity- Hyperreflexia- Global lack of myelination in the cerebral hemispheres seen on MRI- Decreased supratentorial volume- Decreased N-acetyl aspartate seen on MR spectroscopy- Gray matter appears relatively unaffectedLABORATORY ABNORMALITIES- Increased plasma lactateMISCELLANEOUS- Onset in infancy- Two unrelated families have been reported (last curated July 2016)MOLECULAR BASIS- Caused by mutation in the solute carrier family 25 (mitochondrial carrier, aralar), member 12 gene (SLC25A12,603667.0001)▲Close'},\n",

CVS is characterized as recurring episodes lasting a single day to multiple weeks. Each episode is divided into four phases: inter-episodic, prodrome, vomiting, and recovery. Inter-episodic phase (symptom free phase), is characterized as no discernible symptoms, normal everyday activities can occur, and this phase typically lasts one week to one month. The prodrome phase is known as the pre-emetic phase, characterized by the initial feeling of an approaching episode, still able to keep down oral medication. Emetic or vomiting phase is characterized as intense persistent nausea, and repeated vomiting typically lasting hours to days. Recovery phase is typically the phase where vomiting ceases, nausea diminishes or is absent, and appetite returns. This syndrome is most commonly seen in children usually between ages 3 and 7, however adult diagnosis is quite common.[1] This disorder is thought to be closely related to migraines and family history of migraines.[2][3]Contents1 Signs and symptoms2 Genetics3 Diagnosis3.1 Diagnostic criteria4 Treatment5 Prognosis6 Epidemiology7 History8 See also9 References10 Further reading11 External linksSigns and symptoms[edit]AdultsChildrenMean age of diagnosis29–34 years old3–7 years oldMean duration of episodes3–6 daysfew hours to 4 daysMean Inter-episodic duration1–3 months1 week to 1 monthPresence of Prodrome phasecommoncommonRecovery timelasting several dayslasting hours to daysVomitinguniversal up to 6 times an houruniversal up to 6 times an hourAbdominal paincommon (57-70)%common (68-80)%UGI Complicationscommon (38%)common (22-32)%HeadachescommoncommonFevernot commonnot commonDehydration needing IV fluidscommoncommon with longer attacksFamily history with migrainescommon (30-70)%common (40-89)%Psychiatric disorderscommoncommonInter-episodic nausea/paincommonrareMitochondrial DNA disordersnot reportedreportedCannabis usereportednot reportedUnpleasant triggerscommon (67%)common harder to pinpointSufferers may vomit or retch 6–12 times in an hour and an episode may last from a few hours to over three weeks and in some cases months, with a median episode duration of 41 hours.[4]Acid, bile and, if the vomiting is severe, blood may be vomited. Some sufferers will ingest water to reduce the irritation of bile and acid on the esophagus during emesis. Between episodes, the sufferer is usually normal and healthy otherwise but can be in a weak state of fatigue or experience muscle pain. In approximately half of cases the attacks, or episodes, occur in a time-related manner. Each attack is stereotypical; that is, in any given individual, the timing, frequency and severity of attacks is similar. Some sufferers experience episodes that progressively get worse when left untreated, occurring more frequently with reduced symptom free phase.[5]Episodes may happen every few days, every few weeks or every few months, for some happening at common uniform times typically mornings.[5] For other sufferers, there is not a pattern in time that can be recognized. Some sufferers have a warning of an episodic attack; they may experience a prodrome, some documented prodromal symptoms include: unusually intense nausea and pallor, excess salivation, sweating, flushing, rapid/irregular heartbeat, diarrhea, anxiety/panic, food aversion, restlessness/insomnia, irritability, depersonalization, fatigue/listlessness, intense feelings of being hot or chilled, intense thirst, shivering/shaking, retching, tachypnea, abdominal pain/cramping, limb paresthesias, hyperesthesia, photophobia, phonophobia, headache, and dyspnea, heightened sensitivity, especially to light, though sensitivity to smell, sound, pressure, and temperature, as well as oncoming muscle pain and fatigue, are also reported by some patients. Some prodromal symptoms are present inter-episodically as well as during acute phases of illness. The majority of sufferers can identify triggers that may precede an attack. The most common are various foods, infections (e.g., colds), menstruation, extreme physical exertion, lack of sleep, and psychological stresses, both positive and negative.[citation needed]A sufferer may also be light-sensitive (photophobic), sound-sensitive (phonophobic) or, less frequently, temperature- or pressure-sensitive during an attack.[6]Some sufferers also have a strong urge to bathe in warm or cold water. Some sufferers experience insomnia, diarrhea (GI complications), hot and cold flashes, and excessive sweating before an episode. Some sufferers report that they experience a restless sensation or stinging pain along the spine, hands, and feet followed by weakness in both legs. Some of these symptoms may be due to dehydration or hypokalemia from excessive vomiting, rather than the underlying cause of CVS.Genetics[edit]There is no known genetic pathogenesis for CVS. Recent studies suggest many affected individuals have a family history of related conditions, such as migraines, psychiatric disorders and gastrointestinal disorders. Inheritance is thought to be maternal, a possible genetic mitochondrial inheritance. Adolescents show higher possible mitochondrial inheritance and maternal inheritance than found in adults. Single base-pair and DNA rearrangements in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been associated with these traits.[7][8]Diagnosis[edit]This section needs additional citations for verification.

Several other medical conditions, such as cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS), can mimic the same symptoms, and it is important to rule these out. If all other possible causes have been excluded, a diagnosis of CVS using Rome criteria by a physician may be appropriate.[5]Once formal investigations to rule out gastrointestinal or other causes have been conducted, these tests do not need to be repeated in the event of future episodes.[6]Diagnostic criteria[edit]Although there are differences[exampleneeded] between early-onset CVS (babies and children) and late-onset CVS (in adults),[5] there are established criteria to aid in diagnosis of CVS, namely:A history of three or more periods of intense, acute nausea and unremitting vomiting, as well as pain in some cases, lasting hours to days and even weeks or months[9]Intervening symptom-free or reduced-symptom intervals, lasting weeks to monthsThere are repeated cycles of periods (of varying duration) with intense/acute nausea, with or without vomiting, with or without severe pain, followed by periods of reduced symptoms, followed by gradual increase in CVS symptoms until it peaks (peak intensity is generally relative to cycle intensity).Exclusion of metabolic, gastrointestinal, genitourinary or central nervous system structural or biochemical disease, e.g., individuals with specific physical causes (such as intestinal malrotation)Treatment[edit]Treatment for cyclic vomiting syndrome depends on the evident phase of the disorder.[citation needed]Because the symptoms of CVS are similar (or perhaps identical) to those of the disease well-identified as \"abdominal migraine,\"prophylactic migraine medications, such as topiramate and amitriptyline, have seen recent success in treatment for the prodrome, and vomiting, phases, reducing the duration, severity, and frequency of episodes.[10]Therapeutic treatment for the prodromal phase, characterized by the anticipation of an episode, consists of sumatriptan (nasal or oral) an anti-migraine medication, anti-inflammatory drugs to reduce abdominal pain, and possible anti-emetic drugs. These options may be helpful in preventing an episode or reducing the severity of an attack.[citation needed]The most common therapeutic strategies for those already in the vomiting phase are maintenance of salt balance by appropriate intravenous fluids and, in some cases, sedation. Having vomited for a long period prior to attending a hospital, patients are typically severely dehydrated. For a number of patients, potent anti-emetic drugs such as ondansetron (Zofran) or granisetron (Kytril), and dronabinol (Marinol) may be helpful in either preventing an attack, aborting an attack, or reducing the severity of an attack. Many patients seek comfort during episodes by taking prolonged showers and baths typically quite hot. The use of a heating pad may also help reduce abdominal pain.[2]Lifestyle changes may be recommended, such as extended rest, reduction of stress, frequent small meals, abstain from fasting, and possibly cessation of cannabis use. A diet change may be recommended avoid food allergens, eliminating trigger foods such as chocolates, cheese, beer, and red wine.[11][3]Some patients experience relief from inhaled isopropyl alcohol.[12]Prognosis[edit]Fitzpatrick et al. (2007) identified 41 children with CVS. The mean age of the sample was 6 years at the onset of the syndrome, 8 years at first diagnosis, and 13 years at follow-up. As many as 39% of the children had resolution of symptoms immediately or within weeks of the diagnosis. Vomiting had resolved at the time of follow-up in 61% of the sample. Many children, including those in the remitted group, continued to have somatic symptoms such as headaches (in 42%) and abdominal pain (in 37%).[13]Most children who have this disorder miss on average 24 school days a year.[11]The frequency of episodes is higher for some people during times of excitement.[11]Charitable organizations to support sufferers and their families and to promote knowledge of CVS exist in several countries.Complications can include dehydration, dental caries, or an esophageal tear.[14]Epidemiology[edit]The average age at onset is 3–7 years, with described cases as young as 6 days and as old as 73 years.[15] Typical delay in diagnosis from onset of symptoms is 3 years.[15] Females show a slight predominance over males.[15]One study found that 3 in 100,000 five-year-olds are diagnosed with the condition.[16] Two studies on childhood CVS suggest nearly 2% of school-age children may have CVS.[17][18]History[edit]Cyclic vomiting syndrome was first described in France by Swiss physician Henri Clermond Lombard[19] and first described in the English language by pediatrician Samuel Gee in 1882.[20]It has been suggested that Charles Darwin\\'s adult illnesses may have been due to this syndrome.[21][further explanation needed]See also[edit]MigraineReferences[edit]^ .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}Lee LY, Abbott L, Mahlangu B, Moodie SJ, Anderson S (September 2012). \"The management of cyclic vomiting syndrome: a systematic review\".

One of the public spaces after which the condition is named.SpecialtyPsychiatrySymptomsAnxiety in situations perceived to be unsafe, panic attacks[1][2]ComplicationsDepression, substance use disorder[1]Duration> 6 months[1]CausesGenetic and environmental factors[1]Risk factorsFamily history, stressful event[1]Differential diagnosisSeparation anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, major depressive disorder[1]TreatmentCognitive behavioral therapy[3]PrognosisResolution in half with treatment[4]Frequency1.7% of adults[1]Agoraphobia is an anxiety disorder characterized by symptoms of anxiety in situations where the person perceives their environment to be unsafe with no easy way to escape.[1] These situations can include open spaces, public transit, shopping centers, or simply being outside their home.[1] Being in these situations may result in a panic attack.[2] The symptoms occur nearly every time the situation is encountered and last for more than six months.[1] Those affected will go to great lengths to avoid these situations.[1] In severe cases people may become completely unable to leave their homes.[2]Agoraphobia is believed to be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors.[1] The condition often runs in families, and stressful or traumatic events such as the death of a parent or being attacked may be a trigger.[1] In the DSM-5 agoraphobia is classified as a phobia along with specific phobias and social phobia.[1][3] Other conditions that can produce similar symptoms include separation anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and major depressive disorder.[1] Those affected are at higher risk of depression and substance use disorder.[1]Without treatment it is uncommon for agoraphobia to resolve.[1] Treatment is typically with a type of counselling called cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).[3][5] CBT results in resolution for about half of people.[4] Agoraphobia affects about 1.7% of adults.[1] Women are affected about twice as often as men.[1] The condition often begins in early adulthood and becomes less common in old age.[1] It is rare in children.[1] The term \"agoraphobia\" is from Greek ἀγορά, agorā́, meaning a \"place of assembly\" or \"market-place\" and -φοβία, -phobía, meaning \"fear.\"[6][7]Contents1 Signs and symptoms1.1 Panic attacks2 Causes2.1 Substance induced2.2 Attachment theory2.3 Spatial theory2.4 Evolutionary psychology3 Diagnosis4 Treatments4.1 Therapy4.2 Medications4.3 Alternative medicine5 Epidemiology6 Society and culture6.1 Notable cases7 See also8 References9 External linksSigns and symptoms[edit]Agoraphobia is a condition where sufferers become anxious in unfamiliar environments or where they perceive that they have little control. Triggers for this anxiety may include wide-open spaces, crowds (social anxiety), or traveling (even short distances). Agoraphobia is often, but not always, compounded by a fear of social embarrassment, as the agoraphobic fears the onset of a panic attack and appearing distraught in public. Most of the time they avoid these areas and stay in the comfort of their safe haven, usually their home.[1]Agoraphobia is also defined as \"a fear, sometimes terrifying, by those who have experienced one or more panic attacks\".[8] In these cases, the sufferer is fearful of a particular place because they have experienced a panic attack at the same location at a previous time. Fearing the onset of another panic attack, the sufferer is fearful or even avoids a location. Some refuse to leave their homes even in medical emergencies because the fear of being outside of their comfort areas is too great.[9]The sufferers can sometimes go to great lengths to avoid the locations where they have experienced the onset of a panic attack. Agoraphobia, as described in this manner, is actually a symptom professionals check when making a diagnosis of panic disorder. Other syndromes like obsessive compulsive disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder can also cause agoraphobia. Essentially, any irrational fear that keeps one from going outside can cause the syndrome.[10]Agoraphobics may suffer from temporary separation anxiety disorder when certain other individuals of the household depart from the residence temporarily, such as a parent or spouse, or when the agoraphobic is left home alone.Such temporary conditions can result in an increase in anxiety or a panic attack or feeling the need to separate themselves from family or maybe friends.[11][12]People with agoraphobia sometimes fear waiting outside for long periods of time; that symptom can be called \"macrophobia.\"[13]Panic attacks[edit]Agoraphobia patients can experience sudden panic attacks when traveling to places where they fear they are out of control, help would be difficult to obtain, or they could be embarrassed. During a panic attack, epinephrine is released in large amounts, triggering the body\\'s natural fight-or-flight response. A panic attack typically has an abrupt onset, building to maximum intensity within 10 to 15 minutes, and rarely lasts longer than 30 minutes.[14]Symptoms of a panic attack include palpitations, rapid heartbeat, sweating, trembling, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, tightness in the throat, and shortness of breath. Many patients report a fear of dying, fear of losing control of emotions or fear of losing control of behaviors.[14]Causes[edit]Agoraphobia is believed to be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors.[1] The condition often runs in families, and stressful or traumatic events such as the death of a parent or being attacked may be a trigger.[1]Research has uncovered a link between agoraphobia and difficulties with spatial orientation.[15][16] Individuals without agoraphobia are able to maintain balance by combining information from their vestibular system, their visual system, and their proprioceptive sense.A disproportionate number of agoraphobics have weak vestibular function and consequently rely more on visual or tactile signals.They may become disoriented when visual cues are sparse (as in wide-open spaces) or overwhelming (as in crowds).[17] Likewise, they may be confused by sloping or irregular surfaces.[17] In a virtual reality study, agoraphobics showed impaired processing of changing audiovisual data in comparison with subjects without agoraphobia.[18]Substance induced[edit]Chronic use of tranquilizers and sleeping pills such as benzodiazepines has been linked to onset of agoraphobia.[19] In 10 patients who had developed agoraphobia during benzodiazepine dependence, symptoms abated within the first year of assisted withdrawal.[20] Similarly, alcohol use disorders are associated with panic with or without agoraphobia; this association may be due to the long-term effects of alcohol consumption causing a distortion in brain chemistry.[21] Tobacco smoking has also been associated with the development and emergence of agoraphobia, often with panic disorder; it is uncertain how tobacco smoking results in anxiety-panic with or without agoraphobia symptoms, but the direct effects of nicotine dependence or the effects of tobacco smoke on breathing have been suggested as possible causes. Self-medication or a combination of factors may also explain the association between tobacco smoking and agoraphobia and panic.[22]Attachment theory[edit]Main article: Attachment theorySome scholars[23][24] have explained agoraphobia as an attachment deficit, i.e., the temporary loss of the ability to tolerate spatial separations from a secure base.[25] Recent empirical research has also linked attachment and spatial theories of agoraphobia.[26]Spatial theory[edit]In the social sciences, a perceived clinical bias[27] exists in agoraphobia research. Branches of the social sciences, especially geography, have increasingly become interested in what may be thought of as a spatial phenomenon. One such approach links the development of agoraphobia with modernity.[28] Factors considered contributing to agoraphobia within modernity are the ubiquity of cars and urbanization. These have helped develop the expansion of public space, on one hand, and the contraction of private space on the other, thus creating in the minds of agoraphobia-prone people a tense, unbridgeable gulf between the two.Evolutionary psychology[edit]An evolutionary psychology view is that the more unusual primary agoraphobia without panic attacks may be due to a different mechanism from agoraphobia with panic attacks. Primary agoraphobia without panic attacks may be a specific phobia explained by it once having been evolutionarily advantageous to avoid exposed, large, open spaces without cover or concealment. Agoraphobia with panic attacks may be an avoidance response secondary to the panic attacks, due to fear of the situations in which the panic attacks occurred.[29][30]Diagnosis[edit]Most people who present to mental health specialists develop agoraphobia after the onset of panic disorder.[31] Agoraphobia is best understood as an adverse behavioral outcome of repeated panic attacks and subsequent anxiety and preoccupation with these attacks that leads to an avoidance of situations where a panic attack could occur.[32] Early treatment of panic disorder can often prevent agoraphobia.[33] Agoraphobia is typically determined when symptoms are worse than panic disorder, but also do not meet the criteria for other anxiety disorders such as depression.[34] In rare cases where agoraphobics do not meet the criteria used to diagnose panic disorder, the formal diagnosis of agoraphobia without history of panic disorder is used (primary agoraphobia).Treatments[edit]Therapy[edit]Systematic desensitization can provide lasting relief to the majority of patients with panic disorder and agoraphobia.The disappearance of residual and sub-clinical agoraphobic avoidance, and not simply of panic attacks, should be the aim of exposure therapy.[35] Many patients can deal with exposure easier if they are in the company of a friend on whom they can rely.[36][37] Patients must remain in the situation until anxiety has abated because if they leave the situation, the phobic response will not decrease and it may even rise.[37]A related exposure treatment is in vivo exposure, a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy method, that gradually exposes patients to the feared situations or objects.[38] This treatment was largely effective with an effect size from d = 0.78 to d = 1.34, and these effects were shown to increase over time, proving that the treatment had long-term efficacy (up to 12 months after treatment).[38]Psychological interventions in combination with pharmaceutical treatments were overall more effective than treatments simply involving either CBT or pharmaceuticals.[38] Further research showed there was no significant effect between using group CBT versus individual CBT.[38]Cognitive restructuring has also proved useful in treating agoraphobia. This treatment involves coaching a participant through a dianoetic discussion, with the intent of replacing irrational, counterproductive beliefs with more factual and beneficial ones.Relaxation techniques are often useful skills for the agoraphobic to develop, as they can be used to stop or prevent symptoms of anxiety and panic.[39]Medications[edit]Antidepressant medications most commonly used to treat anxiety disorders are mainly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Benzodiazepines, monoamine oxidase inhibitor, and tricyclic antidepressants are also sometimes prescribed for treatment of agoraphobia.[40] Antidepressants are important because some have anxiolytic effects.[37] Antidepressants should be used in conjunction with exposure as a form of self-help or with cognitive behaviour therapy.[37] A combination of medication and cognitive behaviour therapy is sometimes the most effective treatment for agoraphobia.[37]Benzodiazepines and other anxiolytic medications such as alprazolam and clonazepam are used to treat anxiety and can also help control the symptoms of a panic attack. If taken for too long, they can cause dependence. Treatment with benzodiazepines should not exceed 4 weeks. Side effects may include confusion, drowsiness, light-headedness, loss of balance, and memory loss.Alternative medicine[edit]Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) has been studied as a possible treatment for agoraphobia, with poor results.[41] As such, EMDR is only recommended in cases where cognitive-behavioral approaches have proven ineffective or in cases where agoraphobia has developed following trauma.[42]Many people with anxiety disorders benefit from joining a self-help or support group (telephone conference-call support groups or online support groups being of particular help for completely housebound individuals). Sharing problems and achievements with others, as well as sharing various self-help tools, are common activities in these groups. In particular, stress management techniques and various kinds of meditation practices and visualization techniques can help people with anxiety disorders calm themselves and may enhance the effects of therapy, as can service to others, which can distract from the self-absorption that tends to go with anxiety problems. Also, preliminary evidence suggests aerobic exercise may have a calming effect. Since caffeine, certain illicit drugs, and even some over-the-counter cold medications can aggravate the symptoms of anxiety disorders, they should be avoided.[43]Epidemiology[edit]Agoraphobia occurs about twice as commonly among women as it does in men.[44] The gender difference may be attributable to several factors: sociocultural traditions that encourage, or permit, the greater expression of avoidance coping strategies by women (including dependent and helpless behaviors), women perhaps being more likely to seek help and therefore be diagnosed, and men being more likely to abuse alcohol in reaction to anxiety and be diagnosed as an alcoholic.[45] Research has not yet produced a single clear explanation for the gender difference in agoraphobia.[45]Panic disorder with or without agoraphobia affects roughly 5.1% of Americans,[38] and about 1/3 of this population with panic disorder have co-morbid agoraphobia. It is uncommon to have agoraphobia without panic attacks, with only 0.17% of people with agoraphobia not presenting panic disorders as well.[38]Society and culture[edit]Notable cases[edit].mw-parser-output .div-col{margin-top:0.3em;column-width:30em}.mw-parser-output .div-col-small{font-size:90%}.mw-parser-output .div-col-rules{column-rule:1px solid #aaa}.mw-parser-output .div-col dl,.mw-parser-output .div-col ol,.mw-parser-output .div-col ul{margin-top:0}.mw-parser-output .div-col li,.mw-parser-output .div-col dd{page-break-inside:avoid;break-inside:avoid-column}Woody Allen (b. 1935), American actor, director, musician[46]Kim Basinger (b. 1953), American actress[47]Earl Campbell (b. 1955), American pro football player[48]Macaulay Culkin (b. 1980), American actor, known for his portrayal of Kevin McCallister in Home Alone and Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, said he had \"self-diagnosed\" agoraphobia.[49]Paula Deen (b. 1947), American chef, author, and television personality[50]H.L.

       "   'text': \"DescriptionThe Kleine-Levin hibernation syndrome, a rare disorder that occurs predominantly in males, is characterized by episodic attacks of aberrant behavior, hypersomnia, and increased feeding (megaphagia) and sex drives (Kleine, 1925; Levin, 1929).Clinical FeaturesPopper et al. (1980) described a Hawaiian Caucasian kindred in which at least 9 members showed this syndrome. Episodic hypersomnolence was associated with disorientation, vivid hallucinations, compulsive hyperphagia, and erotic behavior. Affected persons were entirely normal between attacks. Five males and 4 females were affected. Three would-be heterozygotes denied attacks.Katz and Ropper (2002) reported an affected brother and sister. A 15-year-old boy developed flu-like symptoms without fever. For 9 days, he remained in bed, slept excessively, and when awake, frequently requested unusual (for him) salty food, finishing whatever amount he was given. During the following 10 months, he had 8 similar episodes of hypersomnia lasting between 7 and 12 days. Throughout the following 5 years, he continued to have spells intermittently, with lessening frequency but of longer duration (as long as 81 days). In 5 years, he had 16 spells. Often, attacks were immediately preceded by stress or slight alcohol consumption. While affected, the patient was observed to be in a light sleep for much of the day, frequently shifting positions and remaining easily arousable. Between spells he was animated and articulate, with normal social behavior, functioning at a high level in college, and maintaining normal peer relationships. The sister reported by Katz and Ropper (2002) began having hypersomnolent spells at age 13 years, with the first preceded by a brief flu-like illness. During episodes, she spent as many as 20 hours per day in bed sleeping or physically inactive. When awake, she was irritable and withdrawn. Her behavior and personal account of her mental state during the spells were essentially identical to her brother's. They had not, however, discussed their experiences extensively. In the next 5 years, she had 18 spells, 1 of them as long as 72 days. She described the spells as 'a persistent sense of unreality and disconnection' from her environment. Numerous medications were ineffective in either preventing or reducing the duration of the spells in either patient. Hypocretin (602358) was present in normal levels in the spinal fluid of 1 of the sibs reported by Katz and Ropper (2002).Huang et al. (2008) reported polysomnographic features in 19 Taiwanese patients with Kleine-Levin syndrome. Studies performed before the end of the first half of the symptomatic period showed a reduction in slow wave sleep with progressive return to normal during the second half, despite persistence of clinical symptoms. REM sleep remained normal in the first half of the episode, but decreased in the second half: the differences between first and second half of episodes were significant for slow wave sleep (p = 0.014) and REM sleep (p = 0.027). The overall mean sleep latency was 9.51 minutes, and 7 of 17 patients had 2 or more sleep onset REM periods during the symptomatic period. Huang et al. (2008) concluded that important changes in sleep occur over time during the symptomatic period, but latency studies do not correlate with symptom onset.Arnulf et al. (2008) reviewed the clinical features of 108 patients with Kleine-Levin syndrome. The group mostly consisted of adolescent boys (76%), and the mean age at onset was 15.7 years. There was an unexpected high frequency of Ashkenazi Jewish individuals. During episodes, most patients reported overall apathy, exhaustion, and dramatically increased sleep, although some reported irritability and aggression. The most common specific symptoms during episodes included sleep 'drunkenness,' (83%) with difficulty awakening and intense dreaming, hyperphagia (66%), hypersexuality (53%), impaired speech (94%) and concentration (91%), fever (68%), altered perception as in a dream state (81%), and psychologic changes (87%) such as irritability, frustration, and depressed mood. All reported restoration of normal function between episodes, with behavior similar to controls, except that patients tended to have a higher body mass index (BMI). The disorder lasted a median of 13.6 years. Personal history revealed that 25% of patients had problems at birth, such as long labor or hypoxia, and 15% had delayed speech, walking, or reading, which was increased compared to controls. There were 5 multiplex families. HLA-DR and HLA-DQ alleles did not differ between patients and controls. Some therapeutic response to amantadine was observed. Overall, patients averaged 19 episodes of a mean of 12.5 days, totaling more than 8 months of incapacitation over 14 years. These findings indicated that the disorder is not as benign as sometimes perceived.PathogenesisCritchley and Hoffman (1942) suggested an infectious or inflammatory etiology for Kleine-Levin syndrome--a notion that was perpetuated by frequent reports of a mild viral illness preceding the first attack in up to 50% of cases.On postmortem examination of a man with Kleine-Levin syndrome who died from aspiration pneumonia associated with hyperphagia, Carpenter et al. (1982) found recent and old lesions in the medial thalamus including the intralaminar nucleus, the medial nucleus, the pulvinar, and some dorsal nuclei. Both inflammatory infiltrates and microglia were present, but there was no neuronal loss. The hypothalamus was not involved.Among 30 unrelated patients with Kleine-Levin syndrome, Dauvilliers et al. (2002) observed that viral infections were the most frequent precipitating factor (70%). The findings were consistent with an autoimmune etiology for the disorder.In a 22-year-old woman with Kleine-Levin syndrome, Hong et al. (2006) observed significant hypoperfusion in the left hypothalamus, bilateral thalami, basal ganglia, bilateral medial and dorsolateral frontal regions, and left temporal lobe during the symptomatic period, using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The findings indicated involvement of the diencephalic regions of the brain.Molecular GeneticsThe sibs reported by Katz and Ropper (2002) shared the HLA-DR2 and -DQ1 antigens.In 30 unrelated patients with Kleine-Levin syndrome, Dauvilliers et al. (2002) found an increased frequency of the HLA-DQB1*0201 allele (see 604305) (28.3% vs 12.5% in controls). One subject and his affected mother were DQB1*0201 homozygous.HistoryLevin (1936) reported 5 additional patients with the disorder. Critchley (1962) reported 11 cases and suggested the eponym, Kleine-Levin syndrome. Pearce (2008) reviewed historical descriptions of Kleine-Levin syndrome.Misc- Predominantly malesNeuro- Episodic attacks of aberrant behavior-Episodic hypersomnia-Disorientation-Vivid hallucinations-Compulsive hyperphagia-Erotic behaviorInheritance- Autosomal dominant▲Close\"},\n",

       "   'title': 'Hereditary pancreatitis',\n",
       "   'text': 'Hereditary pancreatitis is a genetic condition characterized by recurrent episodes of inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis). The pancreas produces enzymes that help digest food, and it also produces insulin, a hormone that controls blood sugar levels in the body. Episodes of pancreatitis can lead to permanent tissue damage and loss of pancreatic function.Signs and symptoms of this condition usually begin in late childhood with an episode of acute pancreatitis. A sudden (acute) attack can cause abdominal pain, fever, nausea, or vomiting. An episode typically lasts from one to three days, although some people may experience severe episodes that last longer. Hereditary pancreatitis progresses to recurrent acute pancreatitis with multiple episodes of acute pancreatitis that recur over a period of at least a year; the number of episodes a person experiences varies. Recurrent acute pancreatitis leads to chronic pancreatitis, which occurs when the pancreas is persistently inflamed. Chronic pancreatitis usually develops by early adulthood in affected individuals. Signs and symptoms of chronic pancreatitis include occasional or frequent abdominal pain of varying severity, flatulence, and bloating. Many individuals with hereditary pancreatitis also develop abnormal calcium deposits in the pancreas (pancreatic calcifications) by early adulthood.Years of inflammation damage the pancreas, causing the formation of scar tissue (fibrosis) in place of functioning pancreatic tissue. Pancreatic fibrosis leads to the loss of pancreatic function in many affected individuals. This loss of function can impair the production of digestive enzymes and disrupt normal digestion, leading to fatty stool (steatorrhea), weight loss, and protein and vitamin deficiencies. Because of a decrease in insulin production due to a loss of pancreatic function, about a quarter of individuals with hereditary pancreatitis will develop type 1 diabetes mellitus by mid-adulthood; the risk of developing diabetes increases with age.Chronic pancreatic inflammation and damage to the pancreas increase the risk of developing pancreatic cancer. The risk is particularly high in people with hereditary pancreatitis who also smoke, use alcohol, have type 1 diabetes mellitus, or have a family history of cancer. In affected individuals who develop pancreatic cancer, it is typically diagnosed in mid-adulthood.Complications from pancreatic cancer and type 1 diabetes mellitus are the most common causes of death in individuals with hereditary pancreatitis, although individuals with this condition are thought to have a normal life expectancy.FrequencyHereditary pancreatitis is thought to be a rare condition. In Europe, its prevalence is estimated to be 3 to 6 per million individuals.CausesMutations in the PRSS1 gene cause most cases of hereditary pancreatitis. The PRSS1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called cationic trypsinogen. This enzyme is produced in the pancreas and helps with the digestion of food. When cationic trypsinogen is needed, it is released (secreted) from the pancreas and transported to the small intestine, where it is cut (cleaved) into its working or active form called trypsin. When digestion is complete and trypsin is no longer needed, the enzyme is broken down.Some PRSS1 gene mutations that cause hereditary pancreatitis result in the production of a cationic trypsinogen enzyme that is prematurely converted to trypsin while it is still in the pancreas. Other mutations prevent trypsin from being broken down. These changes result in elevated levels of trypsin in the pancreas. Trypsin activity in the pancreas can damage pancreatic tissue and can also trigger an immune response, causing inflammation in the pancreas.It is estimated that 65 to 80 percent of people with hereditary pancreatitis have mutations in the PRSS1 gene. The remaining cases are caused by mutations in other genes, some of which have not been identified.Learn more about the genes associated with Hereditary pancreatitisCFTRPRSS1Additional Information from NCBI Gene:CTRCSPINK1Inheritance PatternWhen hereditary pancreatitis is caused by mutations in the PRSS1 gene, it is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In some cases, an affected person inherits the PRSS1 gene mutation from one affected parent. Other cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.It is estimated that 20 percent of people who have the altered PRSS1 gene never have an episode of pancreatitis. (This situation is known as reduced penetrance.) It is unclear why some people with a mutated gene never develop signs and symptoms of the disease.'},\n",

       "   'text': \"A number sign (#) is used with this entry because of evidence that long QT syndrome-14 (LQT14) is caused by heterozygous mutation in the CALM1 gene (114180) on chromosome 14q32.For a general phenotypic description and discussion of genetic heterogeneity of long QT syndrome, see LQT1 (192500).Clinical FeaturesCrotti et al. (2013) reported an Italian girl who underwent cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation (VF) at age 6 months. Electrocardiogram (ECG) after defibrillation showed a markedly prolonged QTc interval (630 ms), frequent episodes of T-wave alternans, and intermittent 2:1 atrioventricular block. Echocardiogram showed normal cardiac anatomy and contractile function. An internal cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) was placed, and multiple episodes of VF were terminated by the ICD in the following months. Despite treatment with various medications as well as left-cardiac sympathetic denervation at age 1 year, the patient had 16 episodes of VF during the first 2 years of life: these were mostly induced by adrenergic stimulation, and either began abruptly or were preceded by a brief episode of torsade de pointes that was not pause-dependent. Her parents were asymptomatic with normal ECGs, and there was no history of sudden death in the family.Marsman et al. (2014) studied a Moroccan family with 5 sibs in which the proband experienced cardiac arrest at age 16 years while romping with a classmate at school; an initial recorded rhythm of VF was converted to a sinus rhythm after 2 defibrillatory shocks. Evaluation revealed no structural or functional cardiac abnormalities, ECG showed a normal QTc interval at rest, and flecainide provocation did not uncover a Brugada ECG pattern. On exercise testing, however, mild prolongation of the QTc interval was revealed (459 ms), which was maximal during early recovery (464 ms). An ICD was placed, and in 12 years of follow-up, the proband did not report any syncopal episodes, nor did the ICD record any events involving ventricular tachycardia. Just 7 months following the index event of the proband, his younger sister died suddenly at age 10 years. The family history also included a sister who had died suddenly at age 9 years. Another sister collapsed on the playground at age 10 years and was successfully resuscitated from VF; during the 8-year period following ICD implantation, she experienced 3 episodes of VF that were terminated by ICD shocks. Exercise testing revealed prolongation of the QTc interval in both early and late recovery (474 and 464 ms, respectively). The youngest sister in the family was asymptomatic but also demonstrated prolonged QTc interval on exercise testing. She underwent implantation of an ICD at 7 years of age, and the device did not discharge in 3 years of follow-up. Both parents were asymptomatic with normal ECGs at rest; however, the mother had prolonged QTc intervals (476 ms) at high heart rates. Marsman et al. (2014) stated that although none of the family members met the diagnostic criteria for long QT syndrome, ECG recordings were not available for a large number of mutation carriers in the family, and it was thus 'difficult to rule out LQTS with certainty.'Molecular GeneticsIn an Italian girl with markedly prolonged QTc intervals and multiple episodes of ventricular fibrillation, who was negative for mutation in the 5 genes most frequently associated with long QT syndrome, Crotti et al. (2013) performed exome sequencing and identified a heterozygous de novo missense mutation in the CALM1 gene (D130G; 114180.0003). Analysis of CALM1 in 82 additional patients with LQTS who had no mutations in known LQTS genes revealed a 3-year-old Greek boy who also carried the D130G mutation, as well as a 14-year-old Italian boy with a phe142-to-leu mutation in CALM1 (F142L; 114180.0004). Neither mutation was found in 1,800 white European controls or in public databases, and functional analysis demonstrated a several-fold reduction in calcium-binding affinity for both variants compared to wildtype calmodulin.In a Moroccan family with mild prolongation of the QTc interval in the recovery phase after exercise as well as onset of ventricular fibrillation within the first 2 decades of life, Marsman et al. (2014) performed whole-exome sequencing and identified a heterozygous mutation in the CALM1 gene (F90L; 114180.0005) that segregated with disease in the family. The mutation was not found in 500 Moroccan controls, and the proband was negative for mutation in 14 genes known to be involved in primary arrhythmia syndromes and arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy.INHERITANCE- Autosomal dominantCARDIOVASCULARHeart- Recurrent episodes of ventricular fibrillation- Ventricular tachycardia, nonsustained (in some patients)- Syncopal episodes (in some patients)- Cardiac arrest (in some patients)- Sudden death (in some patients)- Prolonged QTc interval on electrocardiogram (ECG)- T-wave alternans on ECG (in some patients)- Atrioventricular block, 2:1, on ECG (in some patients)- Torsade de pointes on ECG (in some patients)MISCELLANEOUS- Some patients have onset at birth or in early infancy, whereas other have onset in late childhood or adolescence- Some patients experience neurologic sequelae (seizures or developmental delay) after multiple episodes of cardiac arrest- In some patients, QTc interval is prolonged only during exercise testingMOLECULAR BASIS- Caused by mutation in the calmodulin-1 gene (CALM1,114180.0003)▲Close\"},\n",

       "   'text': \"DescriptionProsopagnosia is the inability to recognize someone by the face alone, in the absence of sensory or intellectual impairment (Schwarzer et al., 2007). Almost all reported cases are of the acquired form, but there is evidence for a familial form as well (McConachie, 1976; de Haan, 1999; Galaburda and Duchaine, 2003; Kennerknecht et al., 2006).Clinical FeaturesMcConachie (1976) described a 12-year-old girl who had never been able to recognize any but the most familiar faces. Examination and testing revealed some evidence of right hemisphere abnormality on EEG, some directional confusion and disturbance of topographic memory, and difficulty with complex visual discrimination and integration. Her mother also reported difficulty with recognizing familiar faces, raising the possibility of familial transmission. McConachie (1976) noted that because so-called 'developmental prosopagnosia,' in which there is no history of brain injury, can be circumvented by various strategies, it might be more common than is generally believed.De Haan and Campbell (1991) reexamined the patient originally described by McConachie (1976) and administered an extensive series of tests of face recognition ability and related functions, comparing her performance to that of 4 women of comparable educational background and age. The patient's basic visuosensory functions, such as acuity, contrast sensitivity, and color perception, were largely intact; and general face perception, e.g., distinguishing between a face and a 'nonface,' was relatively well preserved. Recognition of familiar faces was severely impaired, and she also showed problems with other face-processing tasks, such as analysis of facial expression, and with object recognition. This apparent functional impairment was supported by subsequent studies, which demonstrated a complete absence of covert face recognition.De Haan (1999) studied a family in which several members had difficulty with face recognition to such a degree that the mother would instruct them beforehand about who was coming to visit, and the father once introduced himself to his own daughter when they met in an unusual setting. Upon examination, the father and 2 daughters tested very poorly on a familiar face recognition task, whereas the mother and a brother had no face recognition deficit. Another sister, who reportedly had no difficulty with face recognition, declined to participate in the study.Galaburda and Duchaine (2003) reported a 4-generation family with prosopagnosia, including father-to-son transmission. The proband was a 42-year-old man who recalled incidents early in childhood when he could not recognize close family members, and he had failed to recognize nearly all his relatives at times. It was not until he entered the army that he realized the severity of his problem, when the uniform appearance of his fellow servicemen left him unable to differentiate between people. He also reported that he frequently mistook strangers for acquaintances. His son, mother, and grandmother also had prosopagnosia.Schwarzer et al. (2007), commenting on their clinical experience with 38 hereditary prosopagnosics, stated that all of the patients reported that throughout their entire life they had been unable to recognize people by their faces alone, sometimes not even recognizing very close relatives, and used context and other attributes such as voice and hair to identify individuals. Schwarzer et al. (2007) noted that the perception of facial details is not grossly distorted in these patients, all of whom can perceive normal attractiveness and emotions and can identify gender. In a detailed study of the gaze behavior of 8 hereditary prosopagnosics compared to 4 gender- and age-matched controls, Schwarzer et al. (2007) found that while the control participants focused their gaze on the central facial features in face recognition tasks, the hereditary prosopagnosics had a more dispersed gaze and also fixated on external facial features. The difference in gaze pattern was independent of recognition performance, i.e., even when the prosopagnosics recognized a face correctly, compared to the control participants their gaze was significantly more dispersed. Schwarzer et al. (2007) concluded that the face recognition impairment of hereditary prosopagnosics is reflected in their gaze behavior.Kennerknecht et al. (2007) reported an Indian woman with hereditary prosopagnosia. She described identifying people by hair cuts, glasses, teeth, clothing, and sometimes by smile. She had normal recognition of attractiveness but had difficulty with inner imaging of her parents, close friends, and some objects. Neurologic exam showed no other abnormalities. She was socially well-integrated and was a university student of high caliber. Family history revealed a total of 8 other affected members from both the maternal and paternal sides of the family. Her mother, but not her father, was affected. Kennerknecht et al. (2007) suggested that the occurrence in both sides of the family was consistent with a high prevalence of the disorder.Kennerknecht et al. (2008) reported detailed clinical features of 10 unrelated Chinese medical students with prosopagnosia. All prosopagnosic students had pronounced difficulties in the recognition of close relatives and had often been reproached for not greeting them. All reported the use of compensatory strategies and behavioral adaptation, such as reliance on multiple extrafacial cues including gesture, spectacles, gait, hairstyle, perfume, clothing, and jewelry, or arriving early at social meetings to avoid having to locate people. They also had difficulties in recognizing key actors or actresses in movies or television and had to rely on their friends to navigate them through the stories.InheritanceKennerknecht et al. (2006) reported a German family with prosopagnosia occurring over 3 generations in both sexes and in half sibs, with 2 instances of father-to-son transmission, consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance.Population GeneticsFrom a survey conducted in 3 local high schools and 1 university in Germany, Kennerknecht et al. (2006) analyzed 689 completed questionnaires and identified 65 individuals who were 'highly suspicious' for congenital prosopagnosia. After in-depth interviews of 43 individuals, the diagnosis was established in 17 persons (6 males and 11 females), yielding a prevalence of 2.47% in the German Caucasian population. Of those 17 cases, 14 allowed interviewing of at least 1 first-degree relative, and all had at least 1 affected first-degree relative. Kennerknecht et al. (2006) concluded that congenital prosopagnosia is a very common cognitive disorder that is almost always familial, and suggested that the long-term use of compensatory strategies prevents many affected individuals from realizing that they have a specific dysfunction.Using a questionnaire-based screening method, Kennerknecht et al. (2007) identified 1 female Bengali student with prosopagnosia among a total of 189 native Indian university students.Using a questionnaire of 533 Chinese Han medical students followed by personal interviews in a selected subgroup, Kennerknecht et al. (2008) identified 10 (1.88%) individuals with prosopagnosia, including 4 with a family history of prosopagnosia consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance. In an accompanying commentary, Duchaine (2008) suggested that there may be a difference between heritable forms of the disorder and nonheritable forms. He reported that only 11 (58%) of 19 prosopagnosic individuals in his own study clearly had affected relatives. Duchaine (2008) further suggested that the 6 affected individuals reported by Kennerknecht et al. (2008) who did not have a family history of the disorder may not have had a heritable form, thus reducing the frequency to 0.75%. However, even this reduced frequency would still represent a 'staggering number of Han Chinese with hereditary face recognition problems,' about 9.75 million.HistoryThe term prosopagnosia was coined by Bodamer (1947), from the Greek 'prosopon,' meaning 'face,' and 'agnosia,' meaning 'ignorance.' Joachim Bodamer was a German neurologist who described 3 soldiers with acquired prosopagnosia due to head wounds sustained during World War II.INHERITANCE- Autosomal dominantNEUROLOGICBehavioral Psychiatric Manifestations- Inability to recognize someone familiar by the face alone▲Close\"},\n",

(2007) reported a 13-year-old girl with primary ciliary dyskinesia. She had chronic respiratory infections with bronchiectasis, chronic sinusitis, and serous otitis. She also had situs ambiguus with the heart and the liver located centrally. Electron microscopy showed that 66% of her respiratory cilia had shortened or absent outer dynein arms. The authors reported a unrelated patient who also had chronic respiratory infections with bronchiectasis, chronic sinusitis, and serous otitis, but he had situs inversus totalis. Electron microscopy of his respiratory cilia showed no ultrastructural defect of the respiratory cilia, but 40% were immotile.Molecular GeneticsIn a girl with primary ciliary dyskinesia, Duriez et al. (2007) identified 2 variants in the TXNDC3 gene: one was a pathogenic mutation (607421.0001) and the other a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in a splice site (607421.0002), which was shown to affect alternative splicing of the gene. Each unaffected parent was heterozygous for 1 of the TXNDC3 variants. Duriez et al. (2007) emphasized the unusual molecular mechanism underlying this mendelian autosomal recessive disorder, which is a SNP-induced modification of the ratio of 2 functional isoforms generated by alternative splicing.

These psychiatric disorders are approximately 2–5 times more common in people without aura, and 3–10 times more common in people with aura.[29]Prodrome phase[edit]Prodromal or premonitory symptoms occur in about 60% of those with migraines,[2][30] with an onset that can range from two hours to two days before the start of pain or the aura.[31] These symptoms may include a wide variety of phenomena,[32] including altered mood, irritability, depression or euphoria, fatigue, craving for certain food(s), stiff muscles (especially in the neck), constipation or diarrhea, and sensitivity to smells or noise.[30] This may occur in those with either migraine with aura or migraine without aura.[33] Neuroimaging indicates the limbic system and hypothalamus as the origin of prodromal symptoms in migraine.[34]Aura phase[edit]Flickering animation a scintillating scotoma. The scintillations are of a zigzag pattern starting in the center of vision, surrounded by a somewhat larger area with distortion of shapesAura is a transient focal neurological phenomenon that occurs before or during the headache.[2] Aura appears gradually over a number of minutes (usually occurring over 5-60 minutes) and generally last less than 60minutes.[35][36] Symptoms can be visual, sensory or motor in nature and many people experience more than one.[37] Visual effects occur most frequently: they occur in up to 99% of cases and in more than 50% of cases are not accompanied by sensory or motor effects.[37]Vision disturbances often consist of a scintillating scotoma (an area of partial alteration in the field of vision which flickers and may interfere with a person\\'s ability to read or drive).[2] These typically start near the center of vision and then spread out to the sides with zigzagging lines which have been described as looking like fortifications or walls of a castle.[37] Usually the lines are in black and white but some people also see colored lines.[37] Some people lose part of their field of vision known as hemianopsia while others experience blurring.[37]Sensory aura are the second most common type; they occur in 30–40% of people with auras.[37] Often a feeling of pins-and-needles begins on one side in the hand and arm and spreads to the nose–mouth area on the same side.[37] Numbness usually occurs after the tingling has passed with a loss of position sense.[37] Other symptoms of the aura phase can include speech or language disturbances, world spinning, and less commonly motor problems.[37] Motor symptoms indicate that this is a hemiplegic migraine, and weakness often lasts longer than one hour unlike other auras.[37] Auditory hallucinations or delusions have also been described.[38]Pain phase[edit]Classically the headache is unilateral, throbbing, and moderate to severe in intensity.[35] It usually comes on gradually[35] and is aggravated by physical activity.[14] However, the effects of physical activity on migraine are complex and some researchers have concluded that, while exercise can trigger migraine attacks, regular exercise may have prophylactic effect and decrease frequency of attacks.[39] The feeling of pulsating pain is not in phase with the pulse.[40] In more than 40% of cases, however, the pain may be bilateral and neck pain is commonly associated with it.[41] Bilateral pain is particularly common in those who have migraine without aura.[2] Less commonly pain may occur primarily in the back or top of the head.[2] The pain usually lasts 4 to 72 hours in adults,[35] however in young children frequently lasts less than 1hour.[42] The frequency of attacks is variable, from a few in a lifetime to several a week, with the average being about one a month.[43][44]The pain is frequently accompanied by nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light, sensitivity to sound, sensitivity to smells, fatigue and irritability.[2] Many thus seek a dark and quiet room.[45] In a basilar migraine, a migraine with neurological symptoms related to the brain stem or with neurological symptoms on both sides of the body,[46] common effects include a sense of the world spinning, light-headedness, and confusion.[2] Nausea occurs in almost 90% of people, and vomiting occurs in about one-third.[45] Other symptoms may include blurred vision, nasal stuffiness, diarrhea, frequent urination, pallor, or sweating.[47] Swelling or tenderness of the scalp may occur as can neck stiffness.[47] Associated symptoms are less common in the elderly.[48]Rarely, aura occurs without a subsequent headache.[37] This is known as an acephalgic migraine or silent migraine; however, it is difficult to assess the frequency of such cases because people who do not experience symptoms severe enough to seek treatment may not realize that anything unusual is happening to them and dismiss it without reporting any problems.Postdrome[edit]The migraine postdrome could be defined as that constellation of symptoms occurring once the acute headache has settled.[49] Many report a sore feeling in the area where the migraine was, and some report impaired thinking for a few days after the headache has passed. The person may feel tired or \"hung over\" and have head pain, cognitive difficulties, gastrointestinal symptoms, mood changes, and weakness.[50] According to one summary, \"Some people feel unusually refreshed or euphoric after an attack, whereas others note depression and malaise.\"[51] For some individuals this can vary each time.Cause[edit]The underlying causes of migraines are unknown.[52] However, they are believed to be related to a mix of environmental and genetic factors.[3] They run in families in about two-thirds of cases[5] and rarely occur due to a single gene defect.[53] While migraines were once believed to be more common in those of high intelligence, this does not appear to be true.[54] A number of psychological conditions are associated, including depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder,[55] as are many biological events or triggers.Genetics[edit]Main article: Genetics of migraine headachesStudies of twins indicate a 34% to 51% genetic influence of likelihood to develop migraine.[3] This genetic relationship is stronger for migraine with aura than for migraines without aura.[27] A number of specific variants of genes increase the risk by a small to moderate amount.[53]Single gene disorders that result in migraines are rare.[53] One of these is known as familial hemiplegic migraine, a type of migraine with aura, which is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion.[56][57] Four genes have been shown to be involved in familial hemiplegic migraine.[58] Three of these genes are involved in ion transport.[58] The fourth is an axonal protein associated with the exocytosis complex.[58] Another genetic disorder associated with migraine is CADASIL syndrome or cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy.[2] One meta-analysis found a protective effect from an angiotensin converting enzyme polymorphisms on migraine.[59] The TRPM8 gene, which codes for a cation channel, has been linked to migraines.[60]Triggers[edit]Migraine may be induced by triggers, with some reporting it as an influence in a minority of cases[5] and others the majority.[61] Many things such as fatigue, certain foods, and weather have been labeled as triggers; however, the strength and significance of these relationships are uncertain.[61][62] Most people with migraines report experiencing triggers.[63] Symptoms may start up to 24 hours after a trigger.[5]Physiological aspects[edit]Common triggers quoted are stress, hunger, and fatigue (these equally contribute to tension headaches).[61] Psychological stress has been reported as a factor by 50 to 80% of people.[64] Migraine has also been associated with post-traumatic stress disorder and abuse.[65] Migraine episodes are more likely to occur around menstruation.[64] Other hormonal influences, such as menarche, oral contraceptive use, pregnancy, perimenopause, and menopause, also play a role.[66] These hormonal influences seem to play a greater role in migraine without aura.[54] Migraine episodes typically do not occur during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, or following menopause.[2]Dietary aspects[edit]Between 12 and 60% of people report foods as triggers.[67][68] Evidence for such triggers, however, mostly relies on self-reports and is not rigorous enough to prove or disprove any particular trigger.[69] A clear explanation for why food might trigger migraines is also lacking.[67]There does not appear to be evidence for an effect of tyramine – which is naturally present in chocolate, alcoholic beverages, most cheeses and processed meats – on migraine.[70] Likewise, while monosodium glutamate (MSG) is frequently reported,[71] evidence does not consistently support that it is a dietary trigger.[72]Environmental aspects[edit]A review on potential triggers in the indoor and outdoor environment concluded that there is insufficient evidence to confirm environmental factors as causing migraine. They nevertheless suggested that people living with migraine take some preventive measures related to indoor air quality and lighting. This includes ventilation and various black out items to reduce light at the maximum rate.[73]Pathophysiology[edit]Animation of cortical spreading depressionMigraine is believed to be primarily a neurological disorder,[74][75][76] while others believe it to be a neurovascular disorder with blood vessels playing the key role, although current evidence does not support this completely.[77][78][79][80] Others believe both are likely important.[81][82][83][84] One theory is related to increased excitability of the cerebral cortex and abnormal control of pain neurons in the trigeminal nucleus of the brainstem.[85]Aura[edit]Cortical spreading depression, or spreading depression according to Leão, is a burst of neuronal activity followed by a period of inactivity, which is seen in those with migraines with aura.[86] There are a number of explanations for its occurrence, including activation of NMDA receptors leading to calcium entering the cell.[86] After the burst of activity, the blood flow to the cerebral cortex in the area affected is decreased for two to six hours.[86] It is believed that when depolarization travels down the underside of the brain, nerves that sense pain in the head and neck are triggered.[86]Pain[edit]The exact mechanism of the head pain which occurs during a migraine episode is unknown.[87] Some evidence supports a primary role for central nervous system structures (such as the brainstem and diencephalon),[88] while other data support the role of peripheral activation (such as via the sensory nerves that surround blood vessels of the head and neck).[87] The potential candidate vessels include dural arteries, pial arteries and extracranial arteries such as those of the scalp.[87] The role of vasodilatation of the extracranial arteries, in particular, is believed to be significant.[89]Neuromodulators[edit]Adenosine, a neuromodulator, may be involved.[90] Released after the progressive cleavage of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), adenosine acts on adenosine receptors to put the body and brain in a low activity state by dilating blood vessels and slowing the heart rate, such as before and during the early stages of sleep. Adenosine levels have been found to be high during migraine attacks.[90][91] Caffeine\\'s role as an inhibitor of adenosine may explain its effect in reducing migraine.[92] Low levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin, also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), are also believed to be involved.[93]Calcitonin gene related peptides (CGRPs) have been found to play a role in the pathogenesis of the pain associated with migraine, as levels of it become elevated during an attack.[10][40]Diagnosis[edit]The diagnosis of a migraine is based on signs and symptoms.[5] Neuroimaging tests are not necessary to diagnose migraine, but may be used to find other causes of headaches in those whose examination and history do not confirm a migraine diagnosis.[94] It is believed that a substantial number of people with the condition remain undiagnosed.[5]The diagnosis of migraine without aura, according to the International Headache Society, can be made according to the following criteria, the \"5, 4, 3, 2, 1 criteria\":[14]Five or more attacks—for migraine with aura, two attacks are sufficient for diagnosis.Four hours to three days in durationTwo or more of the following:Unilateral (affecting half the head)PulsatingModerate or severe pain intensityWorsened by or causing avoidance of routine physical activityOne or more of the following:Nausea and/or vomiting;Sensitivity to both light (photophobia) and sound (phonophobia)If someone experiences two of the following: photophobia, nausea, or inability to work or study for a day, the diagnosis is more likely.[95] In those with four out of five of the following: pulsating headache, duration of 4–72 hours, pain on one side of the head, nausea, or symptoms that interfere with the person\\'s life, the probability that this is a migraine is 92%.[10] In those with fewer than three of these symptoms the probability is 17%.[10]Classification[edit]Main article: ICHD classification and diagnosis of migraineMigraine was first comprehensively classified in 1988.[27] The International Headache Society updated their classification of headaches in 2004.[14] A third version was published in 2018.[96] According to this classification, migraine is a primary headache disorder along with tension-type headaches and cluster headaches, among others.[97]Migraine is divided into seven subclasses (some of which include further subdivisions):Migraine without aura, or \"common migraine\", involves migraine headaches that are not accompanied by aura.Migraine with aura, or \"classic migraine\", usually involves migraine headaches accompanied by aura. Less commonly, aura can occur without a headache, or with a nonmigraine headache. Two other varieties are familial hemiplegic migraine and sporadic hemiplegic migraine, in which a person has migraine with aura and with accompanying motor weakness. If a close relative has had the same condition, it is called \"familial\", otherwise it is called \"sporadic\". Another variety is basilar-type migraine, where a headache and aura are accompanied by difficulty speaking, world spinning, ringing in ears, or a number of other brainstem-related symptoms, but not motor weakness. This type was initially believed to be due to spasms of the basilar artery, the artery that supplies the brainstem. Now that this mechanism is not believed to be primary, the symptomatic term migraine with brainstem aura (MBA) is preferred.[46]Childhood periodic syndromes that are commonly precursors of migraine include cyclical vomiting (occasional intense periods of vomiting), abdominal migraine (abdominal pain, usually accompanied by nausea), and benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood (occasional attacks of vertigo).Retinal migraine involves migraine headaches accompanied by visual disturbances or even temporary blindness in one eye.Complications of migraine describe migraine headaches and/or auras that are unusually long or unusually frequent, or associated with a seizure or brain lesion.Probable migraine describes conditions that have some characteristics of migraines, but where there is not enough evidence to diagnose it as a migraine with certainty (in the presence of concurrent medication overuse).Chronic migraine is a complication of migraines, and is a headache that fulfills diagnostic criteria for migraine headache and occurs for a greater time interval.Specifically, greater or equal to 15 days/month for longer than 3 months.[98]Abdominal migraine[edit]The diagnosis of abdominal migraine is controversial.[99] Some evidence indicates that recurrent episodes of abdominal pain in the absence of a headache may be a type of migraine[99][100] or are at least a precursor to migraines.[27] These episodes of pain may or may not follow a migraine-like prodrome and typically last minutes to hours.[99] They often occur in those with either a personal or family history of typical migraine.[99] Other syndromes that are believed to be precursors include cyclical vomiting syndrome and benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood.[27]Differential diagnosis[edit]Other conditions that can cause similar symptoms to a migraine headache include temporal arteritis, cluster headaches, acute glaucoma, meningitis and subarachnoid hemorrhage.[10] Temporal arteritis typically occurs in people over 50 years old and presents with tenderness over the temple, cluster headache presents with one-sided nose stuffiness, tears and severe pain around the orbits, acute glaucoma is associated with vision problems, meningitis with fevers, and subarachnoid hemorrhage with a very fast onset.[10] Tension headaches typically occur on both sides, are not pounding, and are less disabling.[10]Those with stable headaches that meet criteria for migraines should not receive neuroimaging to look for other intracranial disease.[101][102][103] This requires that other concerning findings such as papilledema (swelling of the optic disc) are not present. People with migraines are not at an increased risk of having another cause for severe headaches.Prevention[edit]Main article: Prevention of migrainesPreventive treatments of migraine include medications, nutritional supplements, lifestyle alterations, and surgery. Prevention is recommended in those who have headaches more than two days a week, cannot tolerate the medications used to treat acute attacks, or those with severe attacks that are not easily controlled.[10] Recommended lifestyle changes include stopping tobacco use and reducing behaviors that interfere with sleep.[104]The goal is to reduce the frequency, painfulness, and duration of migraine episodes, and to increase the effectiveness of abortive therapy.[105] Another reason for prevention is to avoid medication overuse headache. This is a common problem and can result in chronic daily headache.[106][107]Medication[edit]Preventive migraine medications are considered effective if they reduce the frequency or severity of the migraine attacks by at least 50%.[108] Guidelines are fairly consistent in rating the anticonvulsants topiramate and divalproex/sodium valproate, and the beta blockers propranolol and metoprolol as having the highest level of evidence for first-line use.[109] Propranolol and topiramate have the best evidence in children; however, evidence only supports short term benefit as of 2020.[104][110]The beta blocker Timolol is also effective for migraine prevention and in reducing migraine attack frequency and severity.[109] While beta blockers are often used for first-line treatment, other antihypertensives also have a proven efficiency in migraine prevention, namely the calcium channel blocker Verapamil[111] and the angiotensin receptor blocker Candesartan.[112][113]Tentative evidence also supports the use of magnesium supplementation.[114] Increasing dietary intake may be better.[115] Recommendations regarding effectiveness varied for the anticonvulsants gabapentin and pregabalin. Frovatriptan is effective for prevention of menstrual migraine.[109]The antidepressants Amitriptyline and venlafaxine are probably also effective.[116] Angiotensin inhibition by either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor antagonist may reduce attacks.[117]Medications in the anti-calcitonin gene-related peptide, including eptinezumab, erenumab, fremanezumab, and galcanezumab, appear to decrease the frequency of migraines by one to two per month.[118] They are, however, expensive: a year of erenumab costs $6,900 as of 2019.[119]Alternative therapies[edit]Acupuncture has a small effect in reducing migraine frequency, compared to sham acupuncture, a practice where needles are placed randomly or do not penetrate the skin.[120] Physiotherapy, massage and relaxation, and chiropractic manipulation might be as effective as propranolol or topiramate in the prevention of migraine headaches; however, the research had some problems with methodology.[121][122] Another review, however, found evidence to support spinal manipulation to be poor and insufficient to support its use.[123]Tentative evidence supports the use of stress reduction techniques such as cognitive behavioral therapy, biofeedback, and relaxation techniques.[64] Regular physical exercise may decrease the frequency.[124]Among alternative medicines, butterbur has the best evidence for its use.[125][126] However, unprocessed butterbur contains chemicals called pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) which can cause liver damage, however there are versions that are PA free.[127] In addition, butterbur may cause allergic reactions in people who are sensitive to plants such as ragweed.[128] There is tentative evidence that coenzyme Q10 reduces migraine frequency.[129]Feverfew has traditionally been used as a treatment for fever, headache and migraine, women’s conditions such as difficulties in labour and regulation of menstruation, relief of stomach ache, toothache and insect bites. During the last decades, it has mainly been used for headache and as a preventive treatment for migraine.[130] The plant parts used for medicinal use are the dried leaves or the dried aerial parts. Several historical data supports feverfew’s traditional medicinal uses.[131] In addition, several clinical studies have been performed assessing the efficacy and safety of feverfew monotherapy in the prevention of migraine.[132] The majority of the clinical trials favoured feverfew over placebo. The data also suggest that feverfew is associated with only mild and transient adverse effects. The frequency of migraine was positively affected after treatment with feverfew. Reduction of migraine severity was also reported after intake of feverfew and incidence of nausea and vomiting decreased significantly. No effect of feverfew was reported in one study.[132]There is tentative evidence for melatonin as an add-on therapy for prevention and treatment of migraine.[133][134] The data on melatonin are mixed and certain studies have had negative results.[133] The reasons for the mixed findings are unclear but may stem from differences in study design and dosage.[133] Melatonin\\'s possible mechanisms of action in migraine are not completely clear, but may include improved sleep, direct action on melatonin receptors in the brain, and anti-inflammatory properties.[133][135]Devices and surgery[edit]Medical devices, such as biofeedback and neurostimulators, have some advantages in migraine prevention, mainly when common anti-migraine medications are contraindicated or in case of medication overuse. Biofeedback helps people be conscious of some physiological parameters so as to control them and try to relax and may be efficient for migraine treatment.[136][137] Neurostimulation uses noninvasive or implantable neurostimulators similar to pacemakers for the treatment of intractable chronic migraine with encouraging results for severe cases.[138][139] A transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulator and a transcranial magnetic stimulator are approved in the United States for the prevention of migraines.[140][141] There is also tentative evidence for transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation decreases the frequency of migraines.[142] Migraine surgery, which involves decompression of certain nerves around the head and neck, may be an option in certain people who do not improve with medications.[143]Management[edit]Main article: Migraine treatmentThere are three main aspects of treatment: trigger avoidance, acute symptomatic control, and medication for prevention.[5] Medications are more effective if used earlier in an attack.[5] The frequent use of medications may result in medication overuse headache, in which the headaches become more severe and more frequent.[14] This may occur with triptans, ergotamines, and analgesics, especially opioid analgesics.[14] Due to these concerns simple analgesics are recommended to be used less than three days per week at most.[144]Analgesics[edit]Recommended initial treatment for those with mild to moderate symptoms are simple analgesics such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or the combination of paracetamol (also known as acetaminophen), aspirin, and caffeine.[10] Several NSAIDs, including diclofenac and ibuprofen have evidence to support their use.[145][146] Aspirin can relieve moderate to severe migraine pain, with an effectiveness similar to sumatriptan.[147] Ketorolac is available in intravenous and intramuscular formulations.[10]Paracetamol, either alone or in combination with metoclopramide, is another effective treatment with a low risk of adverse effects.[148] Intravenous metoclopramide is also effective by itself.[149][150] In pregnancy, paracetamol and metoclopramide are deemed safe as are NSAIDs until the third trimester.[10]Triptans[edit]Triptans such as sumatriptan are effective for both pain and nausea in up to 75% of people.[5][151] When sumatriptan is taken with naproxen it works better.[152] They are the initially recommended treatments for those with moderate to severe pain or those with milder symptoms who do not respond to simple analgesics.[10] The different forms available include oral, injectable, nasal spray, and oral dissolving tablets.[5] In general, all the triptans appear equally effective, with similar side effects. However, individuals may respond better to specific ones.[10] Most side effects are mild, such as flushing; however, rare cases of myocardial ischemia have occurred.[5] They are thus not recommended for people with cardiovascular disease,[10] who have had a stroke, or have migraines that are accompanied by neurological problems.[153] In addition, triptans should be prescribed with caution for those with risk factors for vascular disease.[153] While historically not recommended in those with basilar migraines there is no specific evidence of harm from their use in this population to support this caution.[46] They are not addictive, but may cause medication-overuse headaches if used more than 10 days per month.[154]CGRP receptor antagonists[edit]CGRP receptor antagonists target calcitonin gene-related peptide or it\\'s receptor to prevent migraine headaches or reduce their severity.[36] CGRP is a signaling molecule as well as a potent vasodilator that is involved in the development of a migraine headache.[36] There are four injectable monoclonal antibodies that target CGRP or it\\'s receptor (eptinezumab, erenumab, fremanezumab and galcanezumab) and the medications have demonstrated efficacy in the preventative treatment of episodic and chronic migraine headaches in phase 3 randomized clinical trials.[36] Eptinezumab is available as an infusion every three months, Erenumab and galcanezumab are once monthly injections and fremanezumab is a monthly or quarterly injection.Ergotamines[edit]Ergotamine and dihydroergotamine are older medications still prescribed for migraines, the latter in nasal spray and injectable forms.[5][155] They appear equally effective to the triptans[156] and experience adverse effects that typically are benign.[157] In the most severe cases, such as those with status migrainosus, they appear to be the most effective treatment option.[157] They can cause vasospasm including coronary vasospasm and are contraindicated in people with coronary artery disease.[158]Magnesium[edit]Magnesium is recognized as an inexpensive, over-the-counter supplement which some studies have shown to be effective in both preventing and treating migraine.[159]Other[edit]Intravenous metoclopramide, intravenous prochlorperazine, or intranasal lidocaine are other potential options.[10][150] Metoclopramide or prochlorperazine are the recommended treatment for those who present to the emergency department.[10][150] Haloperidol may also be useful in this group.[150][155] A single dose of intravenous dexamethasone, when added to standard treatment of a migraine attack, is associated with a 26% decrease in headache recurrence in the following 72 hours.[160] Spinal manipulation for treating an ongoing migraine headache is not supported by evidence.[123] It is recommended that opioids and barbiturates not be used due to questionable efficacy, addictive potential, and the risk of rebound headache.[10][36] There is tentative evidence that propofol may be useful if other measures are not effective.[161]Occipital nerve stimulation, may be effective but has the downsides of being cost-expensive and has a significant amount of complications.[162]There is modest evidence for the effectiveness of non-invasive neuromodulatory devices, behavioral therapies and acupuncture in the treatment of migraine headaches.[36] There is little to no evidence for the effectiveness of physical therapy, chiropractic manipulation and dietary approaches to the treatment of migraine headaches.[36] Behavioral treatment of migraine headaches may be helpful for those who may not be able to take medications (for example pregnant women).[36]Due to few medications being approved specifically for the preventative treatment of migraine headaches; many medications such as beta-blockers, anticonvulsive agents such as topiramate or sodium valproate, antidepressants such as amitriptyline and calcium channel blockers such as flunarizine are used off label for the preventative treatment of migraine headaches.[36]Feverfew is registered as a traditional herbal medicine in the Nordic countries under the brand name Glitinum, only powdered feverfew is approved in the Herbal community monograph issued by European Medicines Agency (EMA).Children[edit]Ibuprofen helps decrease pain in children with migraines and is the initially recommended treatment.[163][164] Paracetamol does not appear to be effective in providing pain relief.[163] Triptans are effective, though there is a risk of causing minor side effects like taste disturbance, nasal symptoms, dizziness, fatigue, low energy, nausea, or vomiting.[163] Ibuprofen should be used less than half the days in a month and triptans less than a third of the days in a month to decrease the risk of medication overuse headache.[164]Chronic migraine[edit]Topiramate and botulinum toxin (Botox) have evidence in treating chronic migraine.[116][165] Botulinum toxin has been found to be useful in those with chronic migraine but not those with episodic ones.[166][167] The anti-CGRP monoclonal antibody erenumab was found in one study to decrease chronic migraines by 2.4 days more than placebo.[168]Prognosis[edit]Long-term prognosis in people living with migraine is variable.[25] Most people with migraine have periods of lost productivity due to their disease;[5] however typically the condition is fairly benign[25] and is not associated with an increased risk of death.[169] There are four main patterns to the disease: symptoms can resolve completely, symptoms can continue but become gradually less with time, symptoms may continue at the same frequency and severity, or attacks may become worse and more frequent.[25]Migraine with aura appears to be a risk factor for ischemic stroke[170] doubling the risk.[171] Being a young adult, being female, using hormonal birth control, and smoking further increases this risk.[170] There also appears to be an association with cervical artery dissection.[172] Migraine without aura does not appear to be a factor.[173] The relationship with heart problems is inconclusive with a single study supporting an association.[170] Migraine does not appear to increase the risk of death from stroke or heart disease.[169] Preventative therapy of migraines in those with migraine with aura may prevent associated strokes.[174] People with migraine, particularly women, may develop higher than average numbers of white matter brain lesions of unclear significance.[175]Epidemiology[edit]Disability-adjusted life year for migraines per

affects nearly 15% or approximately one billion people.[11] It is more common in women at 19% than men at 11%.[11] In the United States, about 6% of men and 18% of women experience a migraine attack in a given year, with a lifetime risk of about 18% and 43% respectively.[5] In Europe, migraines affect 12–28% of people at some point in their lives with about 6–15% of adult men and 14–35% of adult women getting at least one yearly.[17] Rates of migraine are slightly lower in Asia and Africa than in Western countries.[54][176] Chronic migraine occurs in approximately 1.4 to 2.2% of the population.[177]These figures vary substantially with age: onset of migraine is most commonly between 15 and 24 years of age, and occur most frequently in those 35 to 45 years of age.[5] In children, about 1.7% of 7year olds and 3.9% of those between 7 and 15 experience migraine, with the condition being slightly more common in boys before puberty.[178] Children as young as two years may be affected.[163] During adolescence, migraine becomes more common among women[178] and this persists for the rest of the lifespan, being twice as common among elderly females than males.[179] In women migraine without aura are more common than migraine with aura; however in men the two types occur with similar frequency.[54]During perimenopause symptoms often get worse before decreasing in severity.[179] While symptoms resolve in about two thirds of the elderly, in 3 to 10% they persist.[48]History[edit]The Head Ache, George Cruikshank (1819)An early description consistent with migraine is contained in the Ebers papyrus, written around 1500BCE in ancient Egypt.[22] In 200 BCE, writings from the Hippocratic school of medicine described the visual aura that can precede the headache and a partial relief occurring through vomiting.[180]A second-century description by Aretaeus of Cappadocia divided headaches into three types: cephalalgia, cephalea, and heterocrania.[181] Galen of Pergamon used the term hemicrania (half-head), from which the word migraine was eventually derived.[181] He also proposed that the pain arose from the meninges and blood vessels of the head.[180] Migraine was first divided into the two now used types – migraine with aura (migraine ophthalmique) and migraine without aura (migraine vulgaire) in 1887 by Louis Hyacinthe Thomas, a French Librarian.[180] The mystical visions of Hildegard von Bingen, which she described as “reflections of the living light\", are consistent with the visual aura experienced during migraines.[182]A trepanated skull, from the Neolithic. The perimeter of the hole in the skull is rounded off by ingrowth of new bony tissue, indicating that the person survived the operation. Trepanation, the deliberate drilling of holes into a skull, was practiced as early as 7,000BCE.[22] While sometimes people survived, many would have died from the procedure due to infection.[183] It was believed to work via \"letting evil spirits escape\".[184] William Harvey recommended trepanation as a treatment for migraines in the 17th century.[185]While many treatments for migraine have been attempted, it was not until 1868 that use of a substance which eventually turned out to be effective began.[180] This substance was the fungus ergot from which ergotamine was isolated in 1918.[186] Methysergide was developed in 1959 and the first triptan, sumatriptan, was developed in 1988.[186] During the 20th century with better study-design, effective preventive measures were found and confirmed.[180]Society and culture[edit]Migraine is a significant source of both medical costs and lost productivity. It has been estimated that migraine is the most costly neurological disorder in the European Community, costing more than €27billion per year.[187] In the United States, direct costs have been estimated at $17billion, while indirect costs — such as missed or decreased ability to work — is estimated at $15billion.[188] Nearly a tenth of the direct cost is due to the cost of triptans.[188] In those who do attend work with a migraine, effectiveness is decreased by around a third.[187] Negative impacts also frequently occur for a person\\'s family.[187]Research[edit]Transcranial magnetic stimulation shows promise[10][189] as does transcutaneous supraorbital nerve stimulation.[190] There is preliminary evidence that a ketogenic diet may help prevent episodic and long-term migraine.[191][192]References[edit]^ a b c d e f .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}\"Headache disorders Fact sheet N°277\".

Vomiting after a coughing spell or an inspiratory whooping sound on coughing, almost doubles the likelihood that the illness is pertussis. The absence of a paroxysmal cough or posttussive emesis, though, makes it almost half as likely.[18]The illness usually starts with mild respiratory symptoms include mild coughing, sneezing, or a runny nose (known as the catarrhal stage). After one to two weeks, the coughing classically develops into uncontrollable fits, sometimes followed by a high-pitched \"whoop\" sound, as the person tries to inhale. About 50% of children and adults \"whoop\" at some point in diagnosed pertussis cases during the paroxysmal stage.This stage usually lasts two to eight weeks, or sometimes longer. A gradual transition then occurs to the convalescent stage, which usually lasts one to four weeks. This stage is marked by a decrease in paroxysms of coughing, although paroxysms may occur with subsequent respiratory infection for many months after the onset of pertussis.[19]Symptoms of pertussis can be variable, especially between immunized and non-immunized people. Those that are immunized can present with a more mild infection; they may only have the paroxysmal cough for a couple of weeks, and it may lack the \"whooping\" characteristic.[20] Although immunized people have a milder form of the infection, they can spread the disease to others who are not immune.[20]Incubation period[edit]The time between exposure and the development of symptoms is on average 7–14 days (range 6–20 days),[21] rarely as long as 42 days.[22]Cause[edit]Pertussis is caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis. It is an airborne disease (through droplets) that spreads easily through the coughs and sneezes of an infected person.[4]Spread from other animals[edit]Uncertainties have existed of B. pertussis and whooping cough as a zoonotic disease since around 1910[23][24] but in the 1930s, knowledge was gained that the bacteria lost their virulent power when repeatedly spread on agar media. This explained the difficulties to reproduce results from different studies as the pre-inoculating handlings of the bacteria were not standardized among scientists.[25]Today it is established that at least some primate species are highly susceptible to B. pertussis and develop clinical whooping cough in high incidence when exposed to low inoculation doses.[26][27] The bacteria may be present in wild animal populations, but this is not confirmed by laboratory diagnosis, although whooping cough is known among wild gorillas.[28] Several zoos also have a long-standing custom of vaccinating their primates against whooping cough.[29]Mechanism[edit]After the bacteria are inhaled, they initially adhere to the ciliated epithelium in the nasopharynx. Surface proteins of B. pertussis, including filamentous hemaglutinin and pertactin, mediate attachment to the epithelium. The bacteria then multiply.[30][31] In infants, who experience more severe disease, the bacteria spread down to the lungs.[31]The bacteria secretes a number of toxins. Tracheal cytotoxin, a fragment of peptidoglycan, kills ciliated epithelial cells and thereby inhibits the mucociliary elevator by which mucus and debris are removed.[32] TCT may contribute to the cough characteristic of pertussis.[33] The cough may also be caused by a yet-to-be identified \"cough toxin\".[34] Pertussis toxin causes lymphocytosis by an unknown mechanism. The elevated number of white blood cells leads to pulmonary hypertension, a major cause of death by pertussis.[32][31] In infants who develop encephalopathy, cerebral hemorrhage and cortical atrophy occur, likely due to hypoxia.[31]Diagnosis[edit]Gram stain of Bordetella pertussisBased on symptoms[edit]A physician\\'s overall impression is most effective in initially making the diagnosis.[35] Single factors are much less useful.[35] In adults with a cough of less than 8 weeks, vomiting after coughing or a \"whoop\" is supportive.[36] If there are no bouts of coughing or there is a fever the diagnosis is unlikely.[36] In children who have a cough of less than 4 weeks vomiting after coughing is somewhat supportive but not definitive.[36]Lab tests[edit]Methods used in laboratory diagnosis include culturing of nasopharyngeal swabs on a nutrient medium (Bordet-Gengou medium), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), direct fluorescent antibody (DFA), and serological methods (e.g. complement fixation test).[37] The bacteria can be recovered from the person only during the first three weeks of illness, rendering culturing and DFA useless after this period, although PCR may have some limited usefulness for an additional three weeks.Serology may be used for adults and adolescents who have already been infected for several weeks to determine whether antibody against pertussis toxin or another virulence factor of B. pertussis is present at high levels in the blood of the person.[38]Differential diagnosis[edit]A similar, milder disease is caused by B. parapertussis.[39]Prevention[edit]The primary method of prevention for pertussis is vaccination.[40] Evidence is insufficient to determine the effectiveness of antibiotics in those who have been exposed, but are without symptoms.[41] Preventive antibiotics, however, are still frequently used in those who have been exposed and are at high risk of severe disease (such as infants).[6]Vaccine[edit]Pertussis vaccines are effective at preventing illness[42] and are recommended for routine use by the World Health Organization[43] and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.[44] The vaccine saved an estimated half a million lives in 2002.[43]The multicomponent acellular pertussis vaccine is 71–85% effective, with greater effectiveness against more severe strains.[42] However, despite widespread vaccination, pertussis has persisted in vaccinated populations and is today \"one of the most common vaccine-preventable diseases in Western countries\".[45] The 21st-century resurgences in pertussis infections is attributed to a combination of waning immunity and bacterial mutations that elude vaccines.[45][46]Immunization does not confer lifelong immunity; a 2011 CDC study indicated that protection may only last three to six years. This covers childhood, which is the time of greatest exposure and greatest risk of death from pertussis.[18][47]An effect of widespread immunization on society has been the shift of reported infections from children aged 1–9 years to infants, adolescents, and adults, with adolescents and adults acting as reservoirs for B. pertussis and infecting infants who have had fewer than three doses of vaccine.[48]Infection induces incomplete natural immunity that wanes over time.[49] A 2005 study said estimates of the duration of infection-acquired immunity range from 7 to 20 years and the different results could be the result of differences in levels of circulating B. pertussis, surveillance systems, and case definitions used. The study said protective immunity after vaccination wanes after 4–12 years.[50] One study suggested that the availability of vaccine exemptions increases the number of pertussis cases.[51]Some studies have suggested that while acellular pertussis vaccines are effective at preventing the disease, they have a limited impact on infection and transmission, meaning that vaccinated people could spread pertussis even though they may have only mild symptoms or none at all.[52][53] Pertussis infection in these persons may be asymptomatic, or present as illness ranging from a mild cough to classic pertussis with persistent cough (i.e., lasting more than 7 days). Even though the disease may be milder in older persons, those who are infected may transmit the disease to other susceptible persons, including unimmunized or incompletely immunized infants. Older persons are often found to have the first case in a household with multiple pertussis cases, and are often the source of infection for children.[19]Treatment[edit]The antibiotics erythromycin, clarithromycin, or azithromycin are typically the recommended treatment.[41] Newer macrolides are frequently recommended due to lower rates of side effects.[6] Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) may be used in those with allergies to first-line agents or in infants who have a risk of pyloric stenosis from macrolides.[6]A reasonable guideline is to treat people age >1 year within 3 weeks of cough onset and infants age <1 year and pregnant women within 6 weeks of cough onset. If the person is diagnosed late, antibiotics will not alter the course of the illness, and even without antibiotics, they should no longer be spreading pertussis.[6] When used early, antibiotics decrease the duration of infectiousness, and thus prevent spread.[6] Short-term antibiotics (azithromycin for 3–5 days) are as effective as long-term treatment (erythromycin 10–14 days) in eliminating B. pertussis with fewer and less severe side effects.[41]People with pertussis are most infectious during the first two weeks following the onset of symptoms.[54]Effective treatments of the cough associated with this condition have not been developed.[55] The use of over the counter cough medications is discouraged and has not been found helpful.[20]Prognosis[edit]Disability-adjusted life year for pertussis per 100,000inhabitants as of 2004..mw-parser-output .refbegin{font-size:90%;margin-bottom:0.5em}.mw-parser-output .refbegin-hanging-indents>ul{list-style-type:none;margin-left:0}.mw-parser-output .refbegin-hanging-indents>ul>li,.mw-parser-output .refbegin-hanging-indents>dl>dd{margin-left:0;padding-left:3.2em;text-indent:-3.2em;list-style:none}.mw-parser-output .refbegin-100{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .refbegin-columns{margin-top:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .refbegin-columns dl,.mw-parser-output .refbegin-columns ol,.mw-parser-output .refbegin-columns ul{margin-top:0}.mw-parser-output .refbegin-columns li,.mw-parser-output .refbegin-columns dd{page-break-inside:avoid;break-inside:avoid-column} .mw-parser-output .legend{page-break-inside:avoid;break-inside:avoid-column}.mw-parser-output .legend-color{display:inline-block;min-width:1.25em;height:1.25em;line-height:1.25;margin:1px 0;text-align:center;border:1px solid black;background-color:transparent;color:black}.mw-parser-output .legend-text{}No data Less than 50 50–100 100–150 150–200 200–250 250–300 300–350 350–400 400–450 450–500 500–550 More than 550 While most healthy older children and adults fully recover, infection in newborns is particularly severe. Pertussis is fatal in an estimated 0.5% of US infants under one year of age.[56] First-year infants are also more likely to develop complications, such as: apneas (31%), pneumonia (12%), seizures (0.6%) and encephalopathy (0.15%).[56] This may be due to the ability of the bacterium to suppress the immune system.[57]Epidemiology[edit]Whooping cough deaths per million persons in 20120–0.9 1–1.9 2–3 4–4.9 5–5.9 6–32 33–38 39–44 45–79 Worldwide, whooping cough affects around 16 million people yearly.[16] One estimate for 2013 stated it resulted in about 61,000 deaths – down from 138,000 deaths in 1990.[17] Another estimated 195,000 child deaths yearly from the disease worldwide.[58] This is despite generally high coverage with the DTP and DTaP vaccines. Pertussis is one of the leading causes of vaccine-preventable deaths worldwide.[59] About 90% of all cases occur in developing countries.[59]Before vaccines, an average of 178,171 cases was reported in the U.S., with peaks reported every two to five years; more than 93% of reported cases occurred in children under 10 years of age. The actual incidence was likely much higher. After vaccinations were introduced in the 1940s, pertussis incidence fell dramatically to approximately 1,000 by 1976. Incidence rates have increased since 1980. In 2015, rates in the United States were 20,762 people.[60]Pertussis is the only vaccine-preventable disease that is associated with increasing deaths in the U.S. The number of deaths increased from four in 1996 to 17 in 2001, almost all of which were infants under one year.[61] In Canada, the number of pertussis infections has varied between 2,000 and 10,000 reported cases each year over the last ten years, and it is the most common vaccine-preventable illness in Toronto.[62]In 2009 Australia reported an average of 10,000 cases a year, and the number of cases had increased.[63] In the U.S. pertussis in adults has increased significantly since about 2004.[64]In 2017, India had a reported 23,766 reported pertussis cases, making it one of the highest reported number of cases of the year.[65] Other countries, such as Germany, had reported 16,183 cases, while Australia and China had a reported number of 12,114 and 10,390 pertussis cases.[65]US outbreaks[edit]An epidemiologist tests blood samples for pertussis during a 2010 outbreak.In 2010 ten infants in California died, and health authorities declared an epidemic encompassing 9,120 cases.[66][67] They found that doctors had failed to correctly diagnose the infants\\' condition during several visits.[68] Statistical analysis identified significant overlap in communities with a cluster of nonmedical child exemptions and cases. The number of exemptions varied widely among communities, but tended to be highly clustered. In some schools, more than three-quarters of parents filed for vaccination exemptions. The data suggest vaccine refusal based on nonmedical reasons and personal belief exacerbated the outbreak. Other factors included reduced duration of immunity following the acellular vaccine and, the fact that most vaccinated adults and older children had not received a booster shot.[69][70]In April and May 2012 pertussis was declared to be at epidemic levels in Washington, with 3,308 cases.[71][72][73] In December 2012 Vermont declared an epidemic of 522 cases.[74] Wisconsin had the highest incidence rate, with 3,877 cases, although it did not make an official epidemic declaration.[73]History[edit]Discovery[edit]B. pertussis was discovered in 1906 by Jules Bordet and Octave Gengou, who also developed the first serology and vaccine. Efforts to develop an inactivated whole-cell vaccine began soon after B. pertussis was cultured that year. In the 1920s, Louis W. Sauer developed a weak vaccine for whooping cough at Evanston Hospital (Evanston, IL). In 1925 Danish physician Thorvald Madsen was the first to test a whole-cell vaccine on a wide scale.[75] Madsen used the vaccine to control outbreaks in the Faroe Islands in the North Sea.Vaccine[edit]In 1932 an outbreak of whooping cough hit Atlanta, Georgia, prompting pediatrician Leila Denmark to begin her study of the disease. Over the next six years her work was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, and in partnership with Emory University and Eli Lilly & Company, she developed the first pertussis vaccine.[76] In 1942 American scientists Grace Eldering, Loney Gordon, and Pearl Kendrick combined the whole-cell pertussis vaccine with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids to generate the first DTP combination vaccine.[77] To minimize the frequent side effects caused by the pertussis component, Japanese scientist Yuji Sato developed an acellular vaccine consisting of purified haemagglutinins (HAs: filamentous strep throat and leukocytosis-promoting-factor HA), which are secreted by B. pertussis. Sato\\'s acellular pertussis vaccine was used in Japan starting in 1981.[78] Later versions of the acellular vaccine in other countries consisted of additional defined components of B. pertussis and were often part of the DTaP combination vaccine.References[edit]^ a b c d e f g h i .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}\"Pertussis (Whooping Cough) Signs & Symptoms\". 22 May 2014.

       "   'text': 'Gianotti Crosti syndrome (GCS) is a rare childhood skin condition characterized by a papular rash with blisters on the skin of the legs, buttocks, and arms. It typically affects children between 9 months and 9 years of age. Skin lesions typically last at least 10 days and often last for several weeks. The lesions are usually preceded by an underlying infection (usually a virus), which may cause associated symptoms such as low-grade fever, sore throat, or symptoms of an upper respiratory infection. When GCS is associated with hepatitis B, Epstein-Barr, or cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, acute hepatitis may also occur. GCS is thought to be a hypersensitive response to the underlying infection. While in many countries the underlying cause is hepatitis B, this is rarely the cause in North America. GCS typically does not require treatment and goes away on its own within 1 to 3 months. In some cases, amild topical steroid cream may be prescribed to relieve itching.'},\n",

       "   'text': 'Episodic dyscontrol syndromeSpecialtyPsychiatryEpisodic dyscontrol syndrome (EDS), otherwise known as intermittent explosive disorder (IED)[1] or sometimes just dyscontrol, is a pattern of abnormal, episodic, and frequently violent and uncontrollable social behavior[2] in the absence of significant provocation;[3] it can result from limbic system diseases, disorders of the temporal lobe,[4] or abuse of alcohol or other psychoactive substances.[5][6]EDS is a clearly identified category in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM IV).[7] EDS may affect children or adults.[8][9][10] Children are often considered to have epilepsy or a mental health problem. The episodes consist of recurrent attacks of uncontrollable rage, usually after minimal provocation, and may last up to an hour. Following an episode, children are frequently exhausted, may sleep and will usually have no recall.[11]Contents1 Cause2 Treatment3 Legal implications4 See also5 References6 External linksCause[edit]This section is empty. You can help by adding to it.(March 2018)Treatment[edit]Treatment for EDS usually involves treating the underlying causative factor(s).This may involve psychotherapy, or medical treatment for diseases.[12]EDS has been successfully controlled in clinical trials using prescribed medications, including carbamazepine,[13][14] ethosuximide,[15] and propranolol.[16]There have been few randomised controlled trials of treatment of EDS/IED. Antidepressants and mood-stabilisers including lithium, sodium valproate and carbamazepine have been used in adults, and occasionally in children with oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder to reduce aggression. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is effective in the treatment of anger. A recent trial randomised adults with IED to 12 weeks of individual therapy, group therapy or waiting list (no therapy). Intervention resulted in an improvement in anger and aggression levels, with no difference between group and individual CBT (Cognitive behavioural therapy). Adolescents and young adults may experience educational and social consequences but also mental health problems, including parasuicide, if IED/EDS is undiagnosed in early childhood.[17]Legal implications[edit]A diagnosis of EDS has been used as a defense in court for persons accused of committing violent crimes including murder.[18][19][20]See also[edit]Intermittent explosive disorderReferences[edit]^ .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}McTague, A.; Appleton, R.

Some people also suffer from tunnel vision, mostly due to blood flow leaving the head to more critical parts of the body in defense. These feelings may provoke a strong urge to escape or flee the place where the attack began (a consequence of the \"fight-or-flight response\", in which the hormone causing this response is released in significant amounts). This response floods the body with hormones, particularly epinephrine (adrenaline), which aid it in defending against harm.[9]A panic attack can result when up-regulation by the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is not moderated by the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS). The most common symptoms include trembling, dyspnea (shortness of breath), heart palpitations, chest pain (or chest tightness), hot flashes, cold flashes, burning sensations (particularly in the facial or neck area), sweating, nausea, dizziness (or slight vertigo), light-headedness, heavy-headedness, hyperventilation, paresthesias (tingling sensations), sensations of choking or smothering, difficulty moving, depersonalization and/or derealization. These physical symptoms are interpreted with alarm in people prone to panic attacks. This results in increased anxiety and forms a positive feedback loop.[10] Shortness of breath and chest pain are the predominant symptoms. People experiencing a panic attack may incorrectly attribute them to a heart attack and thus seek treatment in an emergency room. Because chest pain and shortness of breath are hallmark symptoms of cardiovascular illnesses, including unstable angina and myocardial infarction (heart attack), a diagnosis of exclusion (ruling out other conditions) must be performed before diagnosing a panic attack. It is especially important to do this for people whose mental health and heart health statuses are unknown. This can be done using an electrocardiogram and mental health assessments.Panic attacks are distinguished from other forms of anxiety by their intensity and their sudden, episodic nature.[9] They are often experienced in conjunction with anxiety disorders and other psychological conditions, although panic attacks are not generally indicative of a mental disorder. Causes[edit]There are long-term, biological, environmental, and social causes of panic attacks. In 1993, Fava et al. proposed a staging method of understanding the origins of disorders. The first stage in developing a disorder involves predisposing factors, such as genetics, personality, and a lack of well-being.[11] Panic disorder often occurs in early adulthood, although it may appear at any age. It occurs more frequently in women and more often in people with above-average intelligence.[citation needed] Various twin studies where one identical twin has an anxiety disorder have reported a high incidence of the other twin also having an anxiety disorder diagnosis.[12]Biological causes may include obsessive-compulsive disorder, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder, hypoglycemia, hyperthyroidism, Wilson\\'s disease, mitral valve prolapse, pheochromocytoma, and inner ear disturbances (labyrinthitis). Dysregulation of the norepinephrine system in the locus coeruleus, an area of the brain stem, has been linked to panic attacks.[13]Panic attacks may also occur due to short-term stressors. Significant personal loss, including an emotional attachment to a romantic partner, life transitions, and significant life changes may all trigger a panic attack to occur. A person with an anxious temperament, excessive need for reassurance, hypochondriacal fears,[14] overcautious view of the world,[9] and cumulative stress have been correlated with panic attacks. In adolescents, social transitions may also be a cause.[15]People will often experience panic attacks as a direct result of exposure to an object/situation that they have a phobia for. Panic attacks may also become situationally-bound when certain situations are associated with panic due to previously experiencing an attack in that particular situation. People may also have a cognitive or behavioral predisposition to having panic attacks in certain situations.Some maintaining causes include avoidance of panic-provoking situations or environments, anxious/negative self-talk (\"what-if\" thinking), mistaken beliefs (\"these symptoms are harmful and/or dangerous\"), and withheld feelings.Hyperventilation syndrome may occur when a person breathes from the chest, which can lead to over-breathing (exhaling excessive carbon dioxide related to the amount of oxygen in one\\'s bloodstream). Hyperventilation syndrome can cause respiratory alkalosis and hypocapnia. This syndrome often involves prominent mouth breathing as well. This causes a cluster of symptoms, including rapid heartbeat, dizziness, and lightheadedness, which can trigger panic attacks.[16]Panic attacks may also be caused by substances. Discontinuation or marked reduction in the dose of a substance such as a drug (drug withdrawal), for example, an antidepressant (antidepressant discontinuation syndrome), can cause a panic attack. According to the Harvard Mental Health Letter, \"the most commonly reported side effects of smoking marijuana are anxiety and panic attacks. Studies report that about 20% to 30% of recreational users experience such problems after smoking marijuana.\"[17] Cigarette smoking is another substance that has been linked to panic attacks.[18]A common denominator of current psychiatric approaches to panic disorder is that no real danger exists, and the person\\'s anxiety is inappropriate.[19]Panic disorder[edit]Main article: Panic disorderPeople who have repeated, persistent attacks or feel severe anxiety about having another attack are said to have panic disorder. Panic disorder is strikingly different from other types of anxiety disorders in that panic attacks are often sudden and unprovoked.[20] However, panic attacks experienced by those with panic disorder may also be linked to or heightened by certain places or situations, making daily life difficult.[21]Agoraphobia[edit]Main article: AgoraphobiaAgoraphobia is an anxiety disorder that primarily consists of the fear of experiencing a difficult or embarrassing situation from which the sufferer cannot escape. Panic attacks are commonly linked to agoraphobia and the fear of not being able to escape a bad situation.[22] As the result, severe sufferers of agoraphobia may become confined to their homes, experiencing difficulty traveling from this \"safe place\".[23] The word \"agoraphobia\" is an English adoption of the Greek words agora (αγορά) and Phobos (φόβος). The term \"agora\" refers to the place where ancient Greeks used to gather and talk about issues of the city, so it applies to any or all public places; however, the essence of agoraphobia is a fear of panic attacks especially if they occur in public as the victim may feel like he or she has no escape. In the case of agoraphobia caused by a social phobia or social anxiety, sufferers may be very embarrassed by having a panic attack publicly in the first place. This translation is the reason for the common misconception that agoraphobia is a fear of open spaces, and is not clinically accurate. Agoraphobia, as described in this manner, is a symptom professionals check for when making a diagnosis of panic disorder.People who have had a panic attack in certain situations may develop irrational fears, called phobias, of these situations and begin to avoid them. Eventually, the pattern of avoidance and level of anxiety about another attack may reach the point where individuals with panic disorder are unable to drive or even step out of the house. At this stage, the person is said to have panic disorder with agoraphobia.[citation needed]Experimentally induced[edit]Panic attack symptoms can be experimentally induced in the laboratory by various means. Among them, for research purposes, by administering a bolus injection of the neuropeptide cholecystokinin-tetrapeptide (CCK-4).[24] Various animal models of panic attacks have been experimentally studied.[25]Neurotransmitter imbalances[edit]Many neurotransmitters are affected when the body is under the increased stress and anxiety that accompany a panic attack. Some include serotonin, GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), dopamine, norepinephrine, and glutamate. More research into how these neurotransmitters interact with one another during a panic attack is needed to make any solid conclusions, however.An increase of serotonin in certain pathways of the brain seems to be correlated with reduced anxiety. More evidence that suggests serotonin plays a role in anxiety is that people who take SSRIs tend to feel a reduction of anxiety when their brain has more serotonin available to use.[26]The main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS) is GABA. Most of the pathways that use GABA tend to reduce anxiety immediately.[26]Dopamine\\'s role in anxiety is not well understood. Some antipsychotic medications that affect dopamine production have been proven to treat anxiety. However, this may be attributed to dopamine\\'s tendency to increase feelings of self-efficacy and confidence, which indirectly reduces anxiety.[26]Many physical symptoms of anxiety, such as rapid heart rate and hand tremors, are regulated by norepinephrine. Drugs that counteract norepinephrine\\'s effect may be effective in reducing the physical symptoms of a panic attack.[26] Nevertheless, some drugs that increase \\'background\\' norepinephrine levels such as tricyclics and SNRIs are effective for the long-term treatment of panic attacks, possibly by blunting the norepinephrine spikes associated with panic attacks.[27] Because glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter involved in the central nervous system (CNS), it can be found in almost every neural pathway in the body. Glutamate is likely involved in conditioning, which is the process by which certain fears are formed, and extinction, which is the elimination of those fears.[26]Pathophysiology[edit]The symptoms of a panic attack may cause the person to feel that their body is failing. The symptoms can be understood as follows. First, there is frequently the sudden onset of fear with little provoking stimulus. This leads to a release of adrenaline (epinephrine) which brings about the fight-or-flight response when the body prepares for strenuous physical activity. This leads to an increased heart rate (tachycardia), rapid breathing (hyperventilation) which may be perceived as shortness of breath (dyspnea), and sweating. Because strenuous activity rarely ensues, the hyperventilation leads to a drop in carbon dioxide levels in the lungs and then in the blood. This leads to shifts in blood pH (respiratory alkalosis or hypocapnia), causing compensatory metabolic acidosis activating chemosensing mechanisms that translate this pH shift into autonomic and respiratory responses.[28][29]Moreover, this hypocapnia and release of adrenaline during a panic attack cause vasoconstriction resulting in slightly less blood flow to the head which causes dizziness and lightheadedness.[30][31] A panic attack can cause blood sugar to be drawn away from the brain and toward the major muscles. Neuroimaging suggests heightened activity in the amygdala, thalamus, hypothalamus, and brainstem regions including the periaqueductal gray, parabrachial nucleus, and Locus coeruleus.[32] In particular, the amygdala has been suggested to have a critical role.[33] The combination of increased activity in the amygdala (fear center) and brainstem along with decreased blood flow and blood sugar in the brain can lead to decreased activity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) region of the brain.[34] There is evidence that having an anxiety disorder increases the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).[35] Those affected also have a reduction in heart rate variability.[35]Cardiovascular disease[edit]People who have been diagnosed with panic disorder have approximately double the risk of coronary heart disease.[36] Certain stress responses to depression also have been shown to increase the risk and those diagnosed with both depression and panic disorder are nearly three times more at risk.[36]Diagnosis[edit]DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for a panic attack include a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort, in which four (or more) of the following symptoms developed abruptly and reached a peak within minutes: Palpitations, and/or accelerated heart rateSweatingTrembling or shakingSensations of shortness of breath or being smotheredFeeling of chokingChest pain or discomfortNausea or abdominal distress Feeling dizzy, unsteady, lightheaded, or faintDerealization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (being detached from oneself)Fear of losing control or going insaneSense of impending doomParesthesias (numbness or tingling sensations)Chills or hot flashes In DSM-5, culture-specific symptoms (e.g., tinnitus, neck soreness, headache, and uncontrollable screaming or crying) may be seen. Such symptoms should not count as one of the four required symptoms.Some or all of these symptoms can be found in the presence of a pheochromocytoma.Screening tools such as the Panic Disorder Severity Scale can be used to detect possible cases of disorder and suggest the need for a formal diagnostic assessment.[37][38]Treatment[edit]Panic disorder can be effectively treated with a variety of interventions, including psychological therapies and medication.[9] Cognitive-behavioral therapy has the most complete and longest duration of effect, followed by specific selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.[39] A 2009 review found positive results from therapy and medication and a much better result when the two were combined.[40]Lifestyle changes[edit]Caffeine may cause or exacerbate panic anxiety. Anxiety can temporarily increase during withdrawal from caffeine and various other drugs.[41]Increased and regimented aerobic exercise such as running has been shown to have a positive effect on combating panic anxiety. There is evidence that suggests that this effect is correlated to the release of exercise-induced endorphins and the subsequent reduction of the stress hormone cortisol.[42]There remains a chance of panic symptoms becoming triggered or being made worse due to increased respiration rate that occurs during aerobic exercise. This increased respiration rate can lead to hyperventilation and hyperventilation syndrome, which mimics symptoms of a heart attack, thus inducing a panic attack.[43] The benefits of incorporating an exercise regimen have shown the best results when paced accordingly.[44]Muscle relaxation techniques are useful to some individuals. These can be learned using recordings, videos, or books. While muscle relaxation has proved to be less effective than cognitive-behavioral therapies in controlled trials, many people still find at least temporary relief from muscle relaxation.[14]Breathing exercises[edit]In the great majority of cases, hyperventilation is involved, exacerbating the effects of the panic attack. Breathing retraining exercise helps to rebalance the oxygen and CO2 levels in the blood.[45]David D. Burns recommends breathing exercises for those suffering from anxiety. One such breathing exercise is a 5-2-5 count. Using the stomach (or diaphragm)—and not the chest—inhale (feel the stomach come out, as opposed to the chest expanding) for 5 seconds. As the maximal point at inhalation is reached, hold the breath for 2 seconds. Then slowly exhale, over 5 seconds. Repeat this cycle twice and then breathe \\'normally\\' for 5 cycles (1 cycle = 1 inhale + 1 exhale). The point is to focus on breathing and relax the heart rate. Regular diaphragmatic breathing may be achieved by extending the out-breath by counting or humming.[citation needed]Although breathing into a paper bag was a common recommendation for short-term treatment of symptoms of an acute panic attack,[46] it has been criticized as inferior to measured breathing, potentially worsening the panic attack and possibly reducing needed blood oxygen.[47][48] While the paper bag technique increases needed carbon dioxide and so reduces symptoms, it may excessively lower oxygen levels in the bloodstream.Capnometry, which provides exhaled CO2 levels, may help guide breathing.[49][50]Therapy[edit]According to the American Psychological Association, \"most specialists agree that a combination of cognitive and behavioral therapies are the best treatment for panic disorder. Medication might also be appropriate in some cases.\"[51] The first part of therapy is largely informational; many people are greatly helped by simply understanding exactly what panic disorder is and how many others suffer from it. Many people who suffer from panic disorder are worried that their panic attacks mean they are \"going crazy\" or that the panic might induce a heart attack. Cognitive restructuring helps people replace those thoughts with more realistic, positive ways of viewing the attacks.[52] Avoidance behavior is one of the key aspects that prevent people with frequent panic attacks from functioning healthily.[14] Exposure therapy,[53] which includes repeated and prolonged confrontation with feared situations and body sensations, helps weaken anxiety responses to these external and internal stimuli and reinforce realistic ways of viewing panic symptoms.In deeper level psychoanalytic approaches, in particular object relations theory, panic attacks are frequently associated with splitting (psychology), paranoid-schizoid and depressive positions, and paranoid anxiety. They are often found comorbid with borderline personality disorder and child sexual abuse. Paranoid anxiety may reach the level of a persecutory anxiety state.[54]Meditation may also be helpful in the treatment of panic disorders.[55] There was a meta-analysis of the comorbidity of panic disorders and agoraphobia. It used exposure therapy to treat patients over a period. Hundreds of patients were used in these studies and they all met the DSM-IV criteria for both of these disorders.[56] A result was that thirty-two percent of patients had a panic episode after treatment. They concluded that the use of exposure therapy has lasting efficacy for a client who is living with a panic disorder and agoraphobia.[56]The efficacy of group therapy treatment over conventional individual therapy for people with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia appears similar.[57]Medication[edit]Medication options for panic attacks typically include benzodiazepines and antidepressants. Benzodiazepines are being prescribed less often because of their potential side effects, such as dependence, fatigue, slurred speech, and memory loss.[58] Antidepressant treatments for panic attacks include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors (MAOIs). SSRIs in particular tend to be the first drug treatment used to treat panic attacks. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and tricyclic antidepressants appear similar for short-term efficacy.[59]SSRIs carry a relatively low risk since they are not associated with much tolerance or dependence, and are difficult to overdose with. TCAs are similar to SSRIs in their many advantages but come with more common side effects such as weight gain and cognitive disturbances. They are also easier to overdose on. MAOIs are generally suggested for patients who have not responded to other forms of treatment.[60]While the use of drugs in treating panic attacks can be very successful, it is generally recommended that people also be in some form of therapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy. Drug treatments are usually used throughout the duration of panic attack symptoms and discontinued after the patient has been free of symptoms for at least six months. It is usually safest to withdraw from these drugs gradually while undergoing therapy.[14] While drug treatment seems promising for children and adolescents, they are at an increased risk of suicide while taking these medications and their well-being should be monitored closely.[60]Prognosis[edit]Roughly one-third are treatment-resistant.[61] These people continue to have panic attacks and various other panic disorder symptoms after receiving treatment.[61]Many people being treated for panic attacks begin to experience limited symptom attacks. These panic attacks are less comprehensive, with fewer than four bodily symptoms being experienced.[9]It is not unusual to experience only one or two symptoms at a time, such as vibrations in their legs, shortness of breath, or an intense wave of heat traveling up their bodies, which is not similar to hot flashes due to estrogen shortage. Some symptoms, such as vibrations in the legs, are sufficiently different from any normal sensation that they indicate a panic disorder. Other symptoms on the list can occur in people who may or may not have panic disorder. Panic disorder does not require four or more symptoms to all be present at the same time. Causeless panic and racing heartbeat are sufficient to indicate a panic attack.[9]Epidemiology[edit]In Europe, about 3% of the population has a panic attack in a given year while in the United States they affect about 11%.[2] They are more common in females than in males.[2] They often begin during puberty or early adulthood.[2] Children and older people are less commonly affected.[2] A meta-analysis was conducted on data collected about twin studies and family studies on the link between genes and panic disorder. The researchers also examined the possibility of a link to phobias, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and generalized anxiety disorder. The researchers used a database called MEDLINE to accumulate their data.[62] The results concluded that the aforementioned disorders have a genetic component and are inherited or passed down through genes. For the non-phobias, the likelihood of inheriting is 30–40%, and for the phobias, it was 50–60%.[62]See also[edit]Nervous breakdownPanicReferences[edit]^ a b .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}\"Anxiety Disorders\".

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.(January 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)A skin rash in a person with porphyriaAcute porphyrias[edit]The acute porphyrias are acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), variegate porphyria (VP), aminolevulinic acid dehydratase deficiency porphyria (ALAD) and hereditary coproporphyria (HCP). These diseases primarily affect the nervous system, resulting in episodic crises known as acute attacks. The major symptom of an acute attack is abdominal pain, often accompanied by vomiting, hypertension (elevated blood pressure), and tachycardia (an abnormally rapid heart rate).[4]The most severe episodes may involve neurological complications: typically motor neuropathy (severe dysfunction of the peripheral nerves that innervate muscle), which leads to muscle weakness and potentially to quadriplegia (paralysis of all four limbs) and central nervous system symptoms such as seizures and coma. Occasionally, there may be short-lived psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety, confusion, hallucinations, and, very rarely, overt psychosis. All these symptoms resolve once the acute attack passes. Given the many presentations and the relatively low occurrence of porphyria, patients may initially be suspected to have other, unrelated conditions. For instance, the polyneuropathy of acute porphyria may be mistaken for Guillain–Barré syndrome, and porphyria testing is commonly recommended in those situations.[6]Chronic porphyrias[edit]The non-acute porphyrias are X-linked dominant protoporphyria (XLDPP), congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP), porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), and erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP). None of these are associated with acute attacks; their primary manifestation is with skin disease. For this reason, these four porphyrias—along with two acute porphyrias, VP and HCP, that may also involve skin manifestations—are sometimes called cutaneous porphyrias.Skin disease is encountered where excess porphyrins accumulate in the skin. Porphyrins are photoactive molecules, and exposure to light results in promotion of electrons to higher energy levels. When these return to the resting energy level or ground state, energy is released. This accounts for the property of fluorescence typical of the porphyrins. This causes local skin damage.Two distinct patterns of skin disease are seen in porphyria:Immediate photosensitivity. This is typical of XLDPP and EPP. Following a variable period of sun exposure—typically about 30 minutes—patients complain of severe pain, burning, and discomfort in exposed areas. Typically, the effects are not visible, though occasionally there may be some redness and swelling of the skin.Vesiculo-erosive skin disease. This—a reference to the characteristic blistering (vesicles) and open sores (erosions) noted in patients—is the pattern seen in CEP, PCT, VP, and HCP. The changes are noted only in sun-exposed areas such as the face and back of the hands. Milder skin disease, such as that seen in VP and HCP, consists of increased skin fragility in exposed areas with a tendency to form blisters and erosions, particularly after minor knocks or scrapes. These heal slowly, often leaving small scars that may be lighter or darker than normal skin. More severe skin disease is sometimes seen in PCT, with prominent lesions, darkening of exposed skin such as the face, and hypertrichosis: abnormal hair growth on the face, particularly the cheeks. The most severe disease is seen in CEP and a rare variant of PCT known as hepatoerythropoietic porphyria (HEP); symptoms include severe shortening of digits, loss of skin appendages such as hair and nails, and severe scarring of the skin with progressive disappearance of ears, lips, and nose. Patients may also show deformed, discolored teeth or gum and eye abnormalities.Cause[edit]The porphyrias are generally considered genetic in nature.[citation needed]Genetics[edit]Subtypes of porphyrias depend on which enzyme is deficient.Porphyria typeDeficient enzymeType of porphyriaInheritanceSymptomsPrevalenceX-linked dominant protoporphyria (XLDPP)5-aminolevulinate (ALA) synthase (ALAS)ErythropoieticX-linked dominantPhotosensitivity, cirrhosis[7]Rare; about 50 cases reported[8]Aminolevulinate dehydratase deficiency porphyria (ALADP)5-aminolevulinate dehydratase (ALAD)HepaticAutosomal recessive[9]Abdominal pain, neuropathy[9]Extremely rare; fewer than 10 cases ever reported.[10]Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP)Hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS) formerly porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD)HepaticAutosomal dominant[9]Periodic abdominal pain, peripheral neuropathy, psychiatric disorders, tachycardia[9]1 in 10,000[11]–20,000[11]Congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP)uroporphyrinogen synthase (UROS)ErythropoieticAutosomal recessive[9]Severe photosensitivity with erythema, swelling and blistering.

Generally they do not have symptoms, but may pass the gene onto offspring.[17]Triggers[edit]Acute porphyria can be triggered by a number of drugs, most of which are believed to trigger it by interacting with enzymes in the liver which are made with heme. Such drugs include:[18][19][20]Sulfonamides, including sulfadiazine, sulfasalazine and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.Sulfonylureas like glibenclamide, gliclazide and glimepiride, although glipizide is thought to be safe.Barbiturates including thiopental, phenobarbital, primidone, etc.Systemic treatment with antifungals including fluconazole, griseofulvin, ketoconazole and voriconazole. (Topical use of these agents is thought to be safe due to minimal systemic absorption.)Certain antibiotics like rifapentine, rifampicin, rifabutine, isoniazid, nitrofurantoin and, possibly, metronidazole.Ergot derivatives including dihydroergotamine, ergometrine, ergotamine, methysergide, etc.Certain antiretroviral medications (e.g. indinavir, nevirapine, ritonavir, saquinavir, etc.)ProgestogensSome anticonvulsants including: carbamazepine, ethosuximide, phenytoin, topiramate, valproate.Some painkillers like dextropropoxyphene, ketorolac, metamizole, pentazocineSome cancer treatments like bexarotene, busulfan, chlorambucil, estramustine, etoposide, flutamide, idarubicin, ifosfamide, irinotecan, ixabepilone, letrozole, lomustine, megestrol, mitomycin, mitoxantrone, paclitaxel, procarbazine, tamoxifen, topotecanSome antidepressants like imipramine, phenelzine, trazodoneSome antipsychotics like risperidone, ziprasidoneSome retinoids used for skin conditions like acitretin and isotretinoinMiscellaneous others including: cocaine, methyldopa, fenfluramine, disulfiram, orphenadrine, pentoxifylline, and sodium aurothiomalate.Pathogenesis[edit]Heme synthesis—note that some reactions occur in the cytoplasm and some in the mitochondrion (yellow)In humans, porphyrins are the main precursors of heme, an essential constituent of hemoglobin, myoglobin, catalase, peroxidase, and P450 liver cytochromes.[citation needed]The body requires porphyrins to produce heme, which is used to carry oxygen in the blood among other things, but in the porphyrias there is a deficiency (inherited or acquired) of the enzymes that transform the various porphyrins into others, leading to abnormally high levels of one or more of these substances. Porphyrias are classified in two ways, by symptoms and by pathophysiology. Physiologically, porphyrias are classified as liver or erythropoietic based on the sites of accumulation of heme precursors, either in the liver or in the bone marrow and red blood cells.[21]Deficiency in the enzymes of the porphyrin pathway leads to insufficient production of heme. Heme function plays a central role in cellular metabolism. This is not the main problem in the porphyrias; most heme synthesis enzymes—even dysfunctional enzymes—have enough residual activity to assist in heme biosynthesis. The principal problem in these deficiencies is the accumulation of porphyrins, the heme precursors, which are toxic to tissue in high concentrations. The chemical properties of these intermediates determine the location of accumulation, whether they induce photosensitivity, and whether the intermediate is excreted (in the urine or feces).There are eight enzymes in the heme biosynthetic pathway, four of which—the first one and the last three—are in the mitochondria, while the other four are in the cytosol. Defects in any of these can lead to some form of porphyria.The hepatic porphyrias are characterized by acute neurological attacks (seizures, psychosis, extreme back and abdominal pain, and an acute polyneuropathy), while the erythropoietic forms present with skin problems, usually a light-sensitive blistering rash and increased hair growth.Variegate porphyria (also porphyria variegata or mixed porphyria), which results from a partial deficiency in PROTO oxidase, manifests itself with skin lesions similar to those of porphyria cutanea tarda combined with acute neurologic attacks. Hereditary coproporphyria, which is characterized by a deficiency in coproporphyrinogen oxidase, coded for by the CPOX gene, may also present with both acute neurologic attacks and cutaneous lesions. All other porphyrias are either skin- or nerve-predominant.[citation needed]Diagnosis[edit]Porphyrin studies[edit]Porphyria is diagnosed through biochemical analysis of blood, urine, and stool.[12][22] In general, urine estimation of porphobilinogen (PBG) is the first step if acute porphyria is suspected. As a result of feedback, the decreased production of heme leads to increased production of precursors, PBG being one of the first substances in the porphyrin synthesis pathway.[23] In nearly all cases of acute porphyria syndromes, urinary PBG is markedly elevated except for the very rare ALA dehydratase deficiency or in patients with symptoms due to hereditary tyrosinemia type I.[24] In cases ofmercury- or arsenic poisoning-induced porphyria, other changes in porphyrin profiles appear, most notably elevations of uroporphyrins I & III, coproporphyrins I & III, and pre-coproporphyrin.[25]Repeat testing during an attack and subsequent attacks may be necessary in order to detect a porphyria, as levels may be normal or near-normal between attacks. The urine screening test has been known to fail in the initial stages of a severe, life-threatening attack of acute intermittent porphyria.[citation needed]Up to 90% of the genetic carriers of the more common, dominantly inherited acute hepatic porphyrias (acute intermittent porphyria, hereditary coproporphyria, variegate porphyria) have been noted in DNA tests to be latent for classic symptoms and may require DNA or enzyme testing. The exception to this may be latent post-puberty genetic carriers of hereditary coproporphyria.[citation needed]As most porphyrias are rare conditions, general hospital labs typically do not have the expertise, technology, or staff time to perform porphyria testing. In general, testing involves sending samples of blood, stool, and urine to a reference laboratory.[12] All samples to detect porphyrins must be handled properly. Samples should be taken during an acute attack; otherwise a false negative result may occur. Samples must be protected from light and either refrigerated or preserved.[12]If all the porphyrin studies are negative, one must consider pseudoporphyria. A careful medication review often will find the cause of pseudoporphyria.Additional tests[edit]Further diagnostic tests of affected organs may be required, such as nerve conduction studies for neuropathy or an ultrasound of the liver. Basic biochemical tests may assist in identifying liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma, and other organ problems.[citation needed]Management[edit]Acute porphyria[edit]Carbohydrate administration[edit]Often, empirical treatment is required if the diagnostic suspicion of a porphyria is high since acute attacks can be fatal. A high-carbohydrate diet is typically recommended; in severe attacks, a dextrose 10% infusion is commenced, which may aid in recovery by suppressing heme synthesis, which in turn reduces the rate of porphyrin accumulation.However, this can worsen hyponatraemia and should be done with extreme caution as it can prove fatal.[26]Heme analogs[edit]Hematin (trade name Panhematin) and heme arginate (trade name NormoSang) are the drugs of choice in acute porphyria, in the United States and the United Kingdom, respectively. These drugs need to be given very early in an attack to be effective; effectiveness varies amongst individuals. They are not curative drugs but can shorten attacks and reduce the intensity of an attack. Side effects are rare but can be serious. These heme-like substances theoretically inhibit ALA synthase and hence the accumulation of toxic precursors. In the United Kingdom, supplies of NormoSang are kept at two national centers; emergency supply is available from St Thomas\\'s Hospital, London.[27] In the United States, Lundbeck manufactures and supplies Panhematin for infusion.[28]Heme arginate (NormoSang) is used during crises but also in preventive treatment to avoid crises, one treatment every 10 days.[citation needed]Any sign of low blood sodium (hyponatremia) or weakness should be treated with the addition of hematin, heme arginate, or even tin mesoporphyrin, as these are signs of impending syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) or peripheral nervous system involvement that may be localized or severe, progressing to bulbar paresis and respiratory paralysis.[citation needed]Cimetidine[edit]Cimetidine has also been reported to be effective for acute porphyric crisis and possibly effective for long-term prophylaxis.[29]Symptom control[edit]Pain is severe, frequently out of proportion to physical signs, and often requires the use of opiates to reduce it to tolerable levels. Pain should be treated as early as medically possible. Nausea can be severe; it may respond to phenothiazine drugs but is sometimes intractable. Hot baths and showers may lessen nausea temporarily, though caution should be used to avoid burns or falls.[citation needed]Early identification[edit]It is recommended that patients with a history of acute porphyria, and even genetic carriers, wear an alert bracelet or other identification at all times. This is in case they develop severe symptoms, or in case of accidents where there is a potential for drug exposure, and as a result they are unable to explain their condition to healthcare professionals. Some drugs are absolutely contraindicated for patients with any form of porphyria.[30]Neurologic and psychiatric disorders[edit]Patients who experience frequent attacks can develop chronic neuropathic pain in extremities as well as chronic pain in the abdomen.[31] Intestinal pseudo-obstruction, ileus, intussusception, hypoganglionosis, and encopresis in children have been associated with porphyrias. This is thought to be due to axonal nerve deterioration in affected areas of the nervous system and vagal nerve dysfunction. Pain treatment with long-acting opioids, such as morphine, is often indicated, and, in cases where seizure or neuropathy is present, gabapentin is known to improve outcome.[32]Seizures often accompany this disease. Most seizure medications exacerbate this condition. Treatment can be problematic: barbiturates especially must be avoided. Some benzodiazepines are safe and, when used in conjunction with newer anti-seizure medications such as gabapentin, offer a possible regimen for seizure control. Gabapentin has the additional feature of aiding in the treatment of some kinds of neuropathic pain.[32] Magnesium sulfate and bromides have also been used in porphyria seizures; however, development of status epilepticus in porphyria may not respond to magnesium alone. The addition of hematin or heme arginate has been used during status epilepticus.[33]Depression often accompanies the disease and is best dealt with by treating the offending symptoms and if needed the judicious use of antidepressants. Some psychotropic drugs are porphyrinogenic, limiting the therapeutic scope. Other psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety, restlessness, insomnia, depression, mania, hallucinations, delusions, confusion, catatonia, and psychosis may occur.[34]Underlying liver disease[edit]Some liver diseases may cause porphyria even in the absence of genetic predisposition. These include hemochromatosis and hepatitis C. Treatment of iron overload may be required.[2]Patients with the acute porphyrias (AIP, HCP, VP) are at increased risk over their life for hepatocellular carcinoma (primary liver cancer) and may require monitoring. Other typical risk factors for liver cancer need not be present.[2]Hormone treatment[edit]Hormonal fluctuations that contribute to cyclical attacks in women have been treated with oral contraceptives and luteinizing hormones to shut down menstrual cycles. However, oral contraceptives have also triggered photosensitivity and withdrawal of oral contraceptives has triggered attacks. Androgens and fertility hormones have also triggered attacks.[citation needed] In 2019, givosiran was approved in the United States for the treatment of acute hepatic porphyria.[35][36]Erythropoietic porphyria[edit]These are associated with accumulation of porphyrins in erythrocytes and are rare.The pain, burning, swelling, and itching that occur in erythropoietic porphyrias generally require avoidance of bright sunlight. Most kinds of sunscreen are not effective, but SPF-rated long-sleeve shirts, hats, bandanas, and gloves can help. Chloroquine may be used to increase porphyrin secretion in some EPs.[12] Blood transfusion is occasionally used to suppress innate heme production.The rarest is congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP), otherwise known as Gunther\\'s disease. The signs may present from birth and include severe photosensitivity, brown teeth that fluoresce in ultraviolet light due to deposition of Type 1 porphyrins, and later hypertrichosis. Hemolytic anemia usually develops. Pharmaceutical-grade beta carotene may be used in its treatment.[37] A bone marrow transplant has also been successful in curing CEP in a few cases, although long-term results are not yet available.[38]In December 2014, afamelanotide received authorization from the European Commission as a treatment for the prevention of phototoxicity in adult patients with EPP.[39]Epidemiology[edit]Rates of all types of porphyria taken together have been estimated to be approximately one in 25,000 in the United States.[40] The worldwide prevalence has been estimated to be between one in 500 and one in 50,000 people.[41]Porphyrias have been detected in all races and in multiple ethnic groups on every continent. There are high incidence reports of AIP in areas of India and Scandinavia. More than 200 genetic variants of AIP are known, some of which are specific to families, although some strains have proven to be repeated mutations.History[edit]The underlying mechanism was first described by Felix Hoppe-Seyler in 1871,[42] and acute porphyrias were described by the Dutch physician Barend Stokvis in 1889.[43][44]The links between porphyrias and mental illness have been noted for decades. In the early 1950s, patients with porphyrias (occasionally referred to as \"porphyric hemophilia\"[45]) and severe symptoms of depression or catatonia were treated with electroshock therapy.Vampires and werewolves[edit]Porphyria has been suggested as an explanation for the origin of vampire and werewolf legends, based upon certain perceived similarities between the condition and the folklore.In January 1964, L. Illis\\'s 1963 paper, \"On Porphyria and the Aetiology of Werewolves,\" was published in Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine. Later, Nancy Garden argued for a connection between porphyria and the vampire belief in her 1973 book, Vampires. In 1985, biochemist David Dolphin\\'s paper for the American Association for the Advancement of Science, \"Porphyria, Vampires, and Werewolves: The Aetiology of European Metamorphosis Legends,\" gained widespread media coverage, popularizing the idea.[citation needed]The theory has been rejected by a few folklorists and researchers as not accurately describing the characteristics of the original werewolf and vampire legends or the disease, and as potentially stigmatizing people with porphyria.[46][47]A 1995 article from the Postgraduate Medical Journal (via NIH) explains:As it was believed that the folkloric vampire could move about freely in daylight hours, as opposed to the 20th century variant, congenital erythropoietic porphyria cannot readily explain the folkloric vampire but may be an explanation of the vampire as we know it in the 20th century. In addition, the folkloric vampire, when unearthed, was always described as looking quite healthy (\"as they were in life\"), while due to disfiguring aspects of the disease, sufferers would not have passed the exhumation test. Individuals with congenital erythropoietic porphyria do not crave blood. The enzyme (hematin) necessary to alleviate symptoms is not absorbed intact on oral ingestion, and drinking blood would have no beneficial effect on the sufferer. Finally, and most important, the fact that vampire reports were literally rampant in the 18th century, and that congenital erythropoietic porphyria is an extremely rare manifestation of a rare disease, makes it an unlikely explanation of the folkloric vampire.[48]Notable cases[edit]George III in his coronation robesMary, Queen of Scots c.1578.King George III. The mental illness exhibited by George III in the regency crisis of 1788 has inspired several attempts at retrospective diagnosis. The first, written in 1855, thirty-five years after his death, concluded that he had acute mania. M. Guttmacher, in 1941, suggested manic-depressive psychosis as a more likely diagnosis. The first suggestion that a physical illness was the cause of King George\\'s mental derangement came in 1966, in a paper called \"The Insanity of King George III: A Classic Case of Porphyria\",[49] with a follow-up in 1968, \"Porphyria in the Royal Houses of Stuart, Hanover and Prussia\".[50] The papers, by a mother/son psychiatrist team, were written as though the case for porphyria had been proven, but the response demonstrated that many experts, including those more intimately familiar with the manifestations of porphyria, were unconvinced. Many psychiatrists disagreed with the diagnosis, suggesting bipolar disorder as far more probable. The theory is treated in Purple Secret,[51] which documents the ultimately unsuccessful search for genetic evidence of porphyria in the remains of royals suspected to have had it.[52] In 2005, it was suggested that arsenic (which is known to be porphyrogenic) given to George III with antimony may have caused his porphyria.[53] This study found high levels of arsenic in King George\\'s hair.In 2010, one analysis of historical records argued that the porphyria claim was based on spurious and selective interpretation of contemporary medical and historical sources.[54] The mental illness of George III is the basis of the plot in The Madness of King George, a 1994 British film based upon the 1991 Alan Bennett play, The Madness of George III. The closing credits of the film include the comment that the King\\'s symptoms suggest that he had porphyria and notes that the disease is \"periodic, unpredictable, and hereditary\".Descendants of George III. Among other descendants of George III theorized by the authors of Purple Secret to have had porphyria (based on analysis of their extensive and detailed medical correspondence) were his great-great-granddaughter Princess Charlotte of Prussia (Emperor William II\\'s eldest sister) and her daughter Princess Feodora of Saxe-Meiningen. They uncovered better evidence that George III\\'s great-great-great-grandson Prince William of Gloucester was reliably diagnosed with variegate porphyria.[55]Mary, Queen of Scots. It is believed that Mary, Queen of Scots, King George III\\'s ancestor, also had acute intermittent porphyria,[56] although this is subject to much debate. It is assumed she inherited the disorder, if indeed she had it, from her father, James V of Scotland. Both father and daughter endured well-documented attacks that could fall within the constellation of symptoms of porphyria.Maria I of Portugal in a c. 1790s portrait attributed to Giuseppe Troni or Thomas Hickey.Maria I of Portugal. Maria I—known as \"Maria the Pious\" or \"Maria the Mad\" because of both her religious fervor and her acute mental illness, which made her incapable of handling state affairs after 1792 – is also thought to have had porphyria. Francis Willis, the same physician who treated George III, was even summoned by the Portuguese court but returned to England after the court limited the treatments he could oversee. Contemporary sources, such as Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Luís Pinto de Sousa Coutinho, noted that the queen had ever-worsening stomach pains and abdominal spasms: hallmarks of porphyria.[57]Vlad III. Vlad III was also said to have had acute porphyria, which may have started the notion that vampires were allergic to sunlight.[58]Vincent van Gogh. Other commentators have suggested that Vincent van Gogh may have had acute intermittent porphyria.[59]King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. The description of this king in Daniel 4 suggests to some that he had porphyria.[60]Physician Archie Cochrane. He was born with porphyria, which caused health problems throughout his life.[61]Paula Frías Allende. The daughter of the Chilean novelist Isabel Allende, she fell into a porphyria-induced coma in 1991,[62] which inspired Isabel to write the memoir Paula, dedicated to her.References[edit]^ a b c d e f g h i j k .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}\"porphyria\".

(2019) reported 2 unrelated children who presented in the first months of life with global developmental delay and then developed refractory seizures associated with hypsarrhythmia at 5 months of age. Patient 1 was a 3.5-year-old girl who had no independent sitting, walking, or speech. She had esotropia and axial hypotonia with hyperkinetic movements of the upper extremities, trunk, and face. Brain imaging showed increased T2-weighted signal intensities in the putamina and periventricular white matter, as well as a thin corpus callosum. Patient 2 was a 2.5-year-old boy who underwent placement of a vagal nerve stimulator at age 16 months, and thereafter became seizure-free. He made some gains in development and was socially responsive, but he had dysphagia, truncal hypotonia, and cortical visual impairment with astigmatism. Brain imaging showed mild generalized cerebral volume loss.Molecular GeneticsIn 2 unrelated children with EIEE72, Sega et al. (2019) identified de novo heterozygous missense mutations in the NEUROD2 gene (E310Q, 601725.0001 and M134T, 601725.0002). The mutations, which were found by whole-exome sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing, were not found in the gnomAD database. Both mutations occurred in the DNA-binding domain. Overexpression of wildtype Neurod2 in X. laevis induces nonneuronal cells to differentiate into neurons and promotes the ectopic expression of neurons expressing mature neural markers. In contrast, expression of the missense mutations into X. laevis resulted in impaired (M134T) or absent (E130Q) ectopic neurons compared to wildtype, suggesting a loss of function.Animal ModelSega et al.

       "   'text': \"Paroxysmal extreme pain disorder is a condition characterized by skin redness and warmth (flushing) and attacks of severe pain in various parts of the body. The area of flushing typically corresponds to the site of the pain. The pain attacks experienced by people with paroxysmal extreme pain disorder usually last seconds to minutes, but in some cases can last hours. These attacks can start as early as infancy. Early in life, the pain is typically concentrated in the lower part of the body, especially around the rectum, and is usually triggered by a bowel movement. Some children may develop constipation, which is thought to be due to fear of triggering a pain attack. Pain attacks in these young children may also be accompanied by seizures, slow heartbeat, or short pauses in breathing (apnea).As a person with paroxysmal extreme pain disorder ages, the location of pain changes. Pain attacks switch from affecting the lower body to affecting the head and face, especially the eyes and jaw. Triggers of these pain attacks include changes in temperature (such as a cold wind) and emotional distress as well as eating spicy foods and drinking cold drinks.Paroxysmal extreme pain disorder is considered a form of peripheral neuropathy because it affects the peripheral nervous system, which connects the brain and spinal cord to muscles and to cells that detect sensations such as touch, smell, and pain.FrequencyParoxysmal extreme pain disorder is a rare condition; approximately 80 affected individuals have been described in the scientific literature.CausesMutations in the SCN9A gene cause paroxysmal extreme pain disorder. The SCN9A gene provides instructions for making one part (the alpha subunit) of a sodium channel called NaV1.7. Sodium channels transport positively charged sodium atoms (sodium ions) into cells and play a key role in a cell's ability to generate and transmit electrical signals. NaV1.7 sodium channels are found in nerve cells called nociceptors that transmit pain signals to the spinal cord and brain.The SCN9A gene mutations that cause paroxysmal extreme pain disorder result in NaV1.7 sodium channels that do not close completely when it is turned off, allowing sodium ions to flow abnormally into nociceptors. This increase in sodium ions enhances transmission of pain signals, leading to the pain attacks experienced by people with paroxysmal extreme pain disorder. It is unknown why the pain attacks associated with this condition change location over time or what causes the other features of this condition such as seizures and changes in breathing.Learn more about the gene associated with Paroxysmal extreme pain disorderSCN9AInheritance PatternThis condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.\"},\n",

       "   'text': \"DescriptionMeniere disease is a chronic illness characterized by intermittent episodes of vertigo lasting from minutes to hours, with fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural pressure (Sajjadi and Paparella, 2008).InheritanceBernstein (1965) reported 7 families with more than 1 case of episodic vertigo and hearing loss. In 1 family identical female twins and the daughter of one of the twins were affected. Three families also had migraine in certain members.In a review of 500 patients with Meniere disease, Paparella (1985) detected a 20% incidence of positive family history and suggested multifactorial etiology.In an exhaustive search for families with Meniere disease, Morrison (1995) identified 41 parent-child pairs with a mean 17.5-year difference in age at onset, favoring anticipation.In a population-based survey of 1,245 Spanish and Italian patients with Meniere disease, Requena et al. (2014) found that 431 (34%) reported a family history of hearing loss or recurrent vertigo, including 133 with possible Meniere disease. However, clinical reevaluation indicated definite Meniere disease in 93 relatives of 76 families. The data indicated that familial Meniere disease occurs in about 8% of patients. Three pairs of monozygotic twins were concordant for the disorder. Estimates of familial aggregation suggested that the disorder is 16 to 48 times more common in sibs and 4 to 12 times more common in offspring of affected individuals compared to the general population. The transmission in most families was consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance and incomplete penetrance. The findings were consistent with a genetic predisposition for the development of Meniere disease.Molecular GeneticsAssociations Pending ConfirmationBy whole-exome sequencing of a Spanish grandmother, mother, and daughter with Meniere disease, Requena et al. (2015) identified 2 novel heterozygous variants, one in the DTNA gene (601239) and the other in the FAM136A gene (616275); all 3 patients carried both variants. The V715F change in the DTNA gene resulted in a splice site alteration with the skipping of exon 21 and production of a shorter alternative transcript, and the Q76X truncating variant in the FAM136A gene resulted in a significant decrease in transcript levels of FAM136A in patient cells. Neither variant was found in the 1000 Genomes Project or Exome Variant Server databases, or in an in-house exome database of 1,000 cases of Meniere disease and 500 controls. Requena et al. (2015) postulated that the variation in these 2 genes contributed to the multifactorial etiology of Meniere disease in this family. Immunohistochemical studies showed that the Fam136a and Dtna proteins are expressed in the sensorineural epithelium of the crista ampullaris in the rat.In a Spanish family in which a man and his paternal uncle had Meniere disease, and the man's father exhibited an otosclerosis-like phenotype, Martin-Sierra et al. (2016) performed whole-exome sequencing and identified a heterozygous missense variant (c.275G-T; G92V) in exon 3 of the PRKCB gene (176970) in all 3 individuals. The mutation was not found in 2 family members who had episodic vestibular symptoms but no hearing loss. The proband had bilateral progressive hearing loss and tinnitus, whereas his affected uncle had unilateral hearing loss and intractable vertigo, for which he underwent labyrinthectomy. The authors concluded that PRKCB-related Meniere disease shows incomplete penetrance, and that additional genetic, epigenetic, or environmental factors were likely to have contributed to the vestibular phenotype in this family.Exclusion StudiesSanchez et al. (2004) found no differences in the nucleotide sequence of exons 4 and 5 of the COCH gene (603196) in 30 patients with definite Meniere disease compared to 30 controls; see DFNA9 (601369).INHERITANCE- Autosomal dominantHEAD & NECKEars- Vertigo, episodic- Hearing impairment, sensorineural, fluctuating- Tinnitus- Aural fullnessMISCELLANEOUS- Onset usually between 30 and 50 years of age- Prevalence of 0.5 to 1 in 1,000- Incomplete penetrance▲Close\"},\n",

At age 2 years, she did not yet walk or speak, and she exhibited clearly delayed psychomotor development. At age 3 years 9 months, occasional convulsions, predominantly localized to the shoulders and upper back, were reported, which led to the diagnosis of myoclonic epilepsy. At age 5 years 6 months, her physical development was in the normal range. She had no dysmorphic features. Screening for inborn errors of metabolism resulted in no indication of amino acidopathies or organic acidurias.Shoichet et al. (2003) reported 2 male probands with X-linked mental retardation without dysmorphic features or additional neurologic abnormalities. The proband in 1 family had delayed early milestones and at the age of 5 years was functioning at an intellectual level of age 3 years. He exhibited language retardation, avoided social contact, and was hyperactive. Both of the mother's brothers were affected but further clinical data were not available. The proband in the other family reached early milestones within the normal time frame, but exhibited a severe language delay. At age 10 years, he was unable to read, had essentially no acquisition of mathematics skills, and required special education. He had mood disorders, with both hyperactivity and aggressiveness.HistoryIn a 7-year-old girl with severe mental retardation and a de novo balanced translocation t(X;7)(p11.3;q11.21), Shoichet et al. (2003) cloned the DNA fragment that contained the X chromosomal and the autosomal breakpoint. In silico sequence analysis demonstrated that the ZNF41 gene was disrupted. Expression studies indicated that ZNF41 transcripts were absent in the patient cell line, suggesting that the mental disorder in this patient resulted from loss of functional ZNF41. Moreover, screening of a panel of patients with nonsyndromic MRX led to the identification of ZNF41 mutations in affected members of 2 unrelated families (314995.0001-314995.0002).Piton et al. (2013) found the mutations in ZNF41 identified by Shoichet et al. (2003) in a total of 7 males in the NHLBI Exome Variant Server; they also found truncating ZNF41 variants in 1 male and 1 female in that database. Based on these findings, as well as a lack of reported ZNF41 mutations since 2003, Piton et al. (2013) classified the involvement of ZNF41 mutations in mental retardation as highly questionable.INHERITANCE- X-linked dominantNEUROLOGICCentral Nervous System- Delayed psychomotor development- Myoclonic epilepsy (1 patient)- Language delayLABORATORY ABNORMALITIES- Translocation (X,7)(p11.3,q11.21) - in some patientsMISCELLANEOUS- Some carrier females have mild featuresMOLECULAR BASIS- Caused by mutation in the zinc finger protein 41 gene (ZNF41,314995.0001)▲Close\"},\n",

In infancy, she showed hypotonia and excessive somnolence. Although onset of generalized tonic-clonic seizures occurred at age 4.75 years, she had previously manifested behavior likely representing other seizure types. The seizures were poorly controlled. EEG showed multifocal epileptiform discharges, even during sleep. Brain MRI showed subtle asymmetric volume loss in the left hippocampus.

The rotavirus vaccine is recommended as a prevention for children.[2][10] Treatment involves getting enough fluids.[2] For mild or moderate cases, this can typically be achieved by drinking oral rehydration solution (a combination of water, salts and sugar).[2] In those who are breastfed, continued breastfeeding is recommended.[2] For more severe cases, intravenous fluids may be needed.[2] Fluids may also be given by a nasogastric tube.[13] Zinc supplementation is recommended in children.[2] Antibiotics are generally not needed.[14] However, antibiotics are recommended for young children with a fever and bloody diarrhea.[1]In 2015, there were two billion cases of gastroenteritis, resulting in 1.3million deaths globally.[6][7] Children and those in the developing world are affected the most.[15] In 2011, there were about 1.7billion cases, resulting in about 700,000 deaths of children under the age of five.[16] In the developing world, children less than two years of age frequently get six or more infections a year.[17] It is less common in adults, partly due to the development of immunity.[18]Contents1 Signs and symptoms2 Cause2.1 Viral2.2 Bacterial2.3 Parasitic2.4

chartGastroenteritis usually involves both diarrhea and vomiting.[18] Sometimes, only one or the other is present.[1] This may be accompanied by abdominal cramps.[1] Signs and symptoms usually begin 12–72hours after contracting the infectious agent.[15] If due to a virus, the condition usually resolves within one week.[18] Some viral infections also involve fever, fatigue, headache and muscle pain.[18] If the stool is bloody, the cause is less likely to be viral[18] and more likely to be bacterial.[19] Some bacterial infections cause severe abdominal pain and may persist for several weeks.[19]Children infected with rotavirus usually make a full recovery within three to eight days.[20] However, in poor countries treatment for severe infections is often out of reach and persistent diarrhea is common.[21]Dehydration is a common complication of diarrhea.[22] Severe dehydration in children may be recognized if the skin color and position returns slowly when pressed.[23] This is called \"prolonged capillary refill\" and \"poor skin turgor\".[23] Abnormal breathing is another sign of severe dehydration.[23] Repeat infections are typically seen in areas with poor sanitation, and malnutrition.[15] Stunted growth and long-term cognitive delays can result.[17]Reactive arthritis occurs in 1% of people following infections with Campylobacter species.[19] Guillain–Barré syndrome occurs in 0.1%.[19] Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) may occur due to infection with Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli or Shigella species.[24] HUS causes low platelet counts, poor kidney function, and low red blood cell count (due to their breakdown).[24] Children are more predisposed to getting HUS than adults.[17] Some viral infections may produce benign infantile seizures.[1]Cause[edit]Viruses (particularly rotavirus) and the bacteria Escherichia coli and Campylobacter species are the primary causes of gastroenteritis.[15][25] There are, however, many other infectious agents that can cause this syndrome including parasites and fungus.[17][4] Non-infectious causes are seen on occasion, but they are less likely than a viral or bacterial cause.[1] Risk of infection is higher in children due to their lack of immunity.[1] Children are also at higher risk because they are less likely to practice good hygiene habits.[1] Children living in areas without easy access to water and soap are especially vulnerable.[1]Viral[edit]Rotavirus, norovirus, adenovirus, and astrovirus are known to cause viral gastroenteritis.[18][26] Rotavirus is the most common cause of gastroenteritis in children,[25] and produces similar rates in both the developed and developing world.[20] Viruses cause about 70% of episodes of infectious diarrhea in the pediatric age group.[13] Rotavirus is a less common cause in adults due to acquired immunity.[27] Norovirus is the cause in about 18% of all cases.[28] Generally speaking, viral gastroenteritis accounts for 21%-40% of the cases of infectious diarrhea in developed countries.[29]Norovirus is the leading cause of gastroenteritis among adults in America accounting for about 90% of viral gastroenteritis outbreaks.[18] These localized epidemics typically occur when groups of people spend time in close physical proximity to each other, such as on cruise ships,[18] in hospitals, and in restaurants.[1] People may remain infectious even after their diarrhea has ended.[18] Norovirus is the cause of about 10% of cases in children.[1]Bacterial[edit]Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (ATCC 14028) as seen with a microscope at 1000 fold magnification and following Gram staining.In some countries,Campylobacter jejuni is the primary cause of bacterial gastroenteritis, with half of these cases associated with exposure to poultry.[19] In children, bacteria are the cause in about 15% of cases, with the most common types being Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter species.[13] If food becomes contaminated with bacteria and remains at room temperature for a period of several hours, the bacteria multiply and increase the risk of infection in those who consume the food.[17] Some foods commonly associated with illness include raw or undercooked meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs; raw sprouts; unpasteurized milk and soft cheeses; and fruit and vegetable juices.[30] In the developing world, especially sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, cholera is a common cause of gastroenteritis. This infection is usually transmitted by contaminated water or food.[31]Toxigenic Clostridium difficile is an important cause of diarrhea that occurs more often in the elderly.[17] Infants can carry these bacteria without developing symptoms.[17] It is a common cause of diarrhea in those who are hospitalized and is frequently associated with antibiotic use.[32] Staphylococcus aureus infectious diarrhea may also occur in those who have used antibiotics.[33] Acute \"traveler\\'s diarrhea\" is usually a type of bacterial gastroenteritis, while the persistent form is usually parasitic.[34] Acid-suppressing medication appears to increase the risk of significant infection after exposure to a number of organisms, including Clostridium difficile, Salmonella, and Campylobacter species.[35] The risk is greater in those taking proton pump inhibitors than with H2 antagonists.[35]Parasitic[edit]A number of parasites can cause gastroenteritis.[13] Giardia lamblia is most common, but Entamoeba histolytica, Cryptosporidium spp., and other species have also been implicated.[13][34] As a group, these agents comprise about 10% of cases in children.[24][34] Giardia occurs more commonly in the developing world, but this type of illness can occur nearly everywhere.[36] It occurs more commonly in persons who have traveled to areas with high prevalence, children who attend day care, men who have sex with men, and following disasters.[36]Transmission[edit]Transmission may occur from drinking contaminated water or when people share personal objects.[15] Water quality typically worsens during the rainy season and outbreaks are more common at this time.[15] In areas with four seasons, infections are more common in the winter.[17] Worldwide, bottle-feeding of babies with improperly sanitized bottles is a significant cause.[15] Transmission rates are also related to poor hygiene, (especially among children),[18] in crowded households,[37] and in those with poor nutritional status.[17] Adults who have developed immunities might still carry certain organisms without exhibiting symptoms.[17] Thus, adults can become natural reservoirs of certain diseases.[17] While some agents (such as Shigella) only occur in primates, others (such as Giardia) may occur in a wide variety of animals.[17]Non-infectious[edit]There are a number of non-infectious causes of inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract.[1] Some of the more common include medications (like NSAIDs), certain foods such as lactose (in those who are intolerant), and gluten (in those with celiac disease). Crohn\\'s disease is also a non-infectious source of (often severe) gastroenteritis.[1] Disease secondary to toxins may also occur. Some food-related conditions associated with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea include: ciguatera poisoning due to consumption of contaminated predatory fish, scombroid associated with the consumption of certain types of spoiled fish, tetrodotoxin poisoning from the consumption of puffer fish among others, and botulism typically due to improperly preserved food.[38]In the United States, rates of emergency department use for noninfectious gastroenteritis dropped 30% from 2006 until 2011. Of the twenty most common conditions seen in the emergency department, rates of noninfectious gastroenteritis had the largest decrease in visits in that time period.[39]Pathophysiology[edit]Gastroenteritis is defined as vomiting or diarrhea due to inflammation of the small or large bowel, often due to infection.[17] The changes in the small bowel are typically noninflammatory, while the ones in the large bowel are inflammatory.[17] The number of pathogens required to cause an infection varies from as few as one (for Cryptosporidium) to as many as 108 (for Vibrio cholerae).[17]Diagnosis[edit]Gastroenteritis is typically diagnosed clinically, based on a person\\'s signs and symptoms.[18] Determining the exact cause is usually not needed as it does not alter management of the condition.[15]However, stool cultures should be performed in those with blood in the stool, those who might have been exposed to food poisoning, and those who have recently traveled to the developing world.[13] It may also be appropriate in children younger than 5, old people, and those with poor immune function.[40] Diagnostic testing may also be done for surveillance.[18] As hypoglycemia occurs in approximately 10% of infants and young children, measuring serum glucose in this population is recommended.[23] Electrolytes and kidney function should also be checked when there is a concern about severe dehydration.[13]Dehydration[edit]A determination of whether or not the person has dehydration is an important part of the assessment, with dehydration typically divided into mild (3–5%), moderate (6–9%), and severe (≥10%) cases.[1] In children, the most accurate signs of moderate or severe dehydration are a prolonged capillary refill, poor skin turgor, and abnormal breathing.[23][41] Other useful findings (when used in combination) include sunken eyes, decreased activity, a lack of tears, and a dry mouth.[1] A normal urinary output and oral fluid intake is reassuring.[23] Laboratory testing is of little clinical benefit in determining the degree of dehydration.[1] Thus the use of urine testing or ultrasounds is generally not needed.[42]Differential diagnosis[edit]Other potential causes of signs and symptoms that mimic those seen in gastroenteritis that need to be ruled out include appendicitis, volvulus, inflammatory bowel disease, urinary tract infections, and diabetes mellitus.[13] Pancreatic insufficiency, short bowel syndrome, Whipple\\'s disease, coeliac disease, and laxative abuse should also be considered.[43] The differential diagnosis can be complicated somewhat if the person exhibits only vomiting or diarrhea (rather than both).[1]Appendicitis may present with vomiting, abdominal pain, and a small amount of diarrhea in up to 33% of cases.[1] This is in contrast to the large amount of diarrhea that is typical of gastroenteritis.[1] Infections of the lungs or urinary tract in children may also cause vomiting or diarrhea.[1] Classical diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) presents with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, but without diarrhea.[1] One study found that 17% of children with DKA were initially diagnosed as having gastroenteritis.[1]Prevention[edit]Percentage of rotavirus tests with positive results, by surveillance week, United States, July 2000 – June 2009.Lifestyle[edit]A supply of easily accessible uncontaminated water and good sanitation practices are important for reducing rates of infection and clinically significant gastroenteritis.[17] Personal measures (such as hand washing with soap) have been found to decrease rates of gastroenteritis in both the developing and developed world by as much as 30%.[23] Alcohol-based gels may also be effective.[23] Food or drink that is thought to be contaminated should be avoided.[44]Breastfeeding is important, especially in places with poor hygiene, as is improvement of hygiene generally.[15] Breast milk reduces both the frequency of infections and their duration.[1]Vaccination[edit]Due to both its effectiveness and safety, in 2009 the World Health Organization recommended that the rotavirus vaccine be offered to all children globally.[25][45] Two commercial rotavirus vaccines exist and several more are in development.[45] In Africa and Asia these vaccines reduced severe disease among infants[45] and countries that have put in place national immunization programs have seen a decline in the rates and severity of disease.[46][47] This vaccine may also prevent illness in non-vaccinated children by reducing the number of circulating infections.[48] Since 2000, the implementation of a rotavirus vaccination program in the United States has substantially decreased the number of cases of diarrhea by as much as 80 percent.[49][50][51] The first dose of vaccine should be given to infants between 6 and 15 weeks of age.[25] The oral cholera vaccine has been found to be 50–60% effective over 2years.[52]Management[edit]Gastroenteritis is usually an acute and self-limiting disease that does not require medication.[22] The preferred treatment in those with mild to moderate dehydration is oral rehydration therapy (ORT).[24] For children at risk of dehydration from vomiting, taking a single dose of the anti vomiting medication metoclopramide or ondansetron, may be helpful,[53] and butylscopolamine is useful in treating abdominal pain.[54]Rehydration[edit]The primary treatment of gastroenteritis in both children and adults is rehydration. This is preferably achieved by drinking rehydration solution, although intravenous delivery may be required if there is a decreased level of consciousness or if dehydration is severe.[55][56] Drinking replacement therapy products made with complex carbohydrates (i.e. those made from wheat or rice) may be superior to those based on simple sugars.[57] Drinks especially high in simple sugars, such as soft drinks and fruit juices, are not recommended in children under 5 years of age as they may increase diarrhea.[22] Plain water may be used if more specific ORT preparations are unavailable or the person is not willing to drink them.[22] A nasogastric tube can be used in young children to administer fluids if warranted.[13] In those who require intravenous fluids, one to four hours\\' worth is often sufficient.[58]Dietary[edit]It is recommended that breast-fed infants continue to be nursed in the usual fashion,and that formula-fed infants continue their formula immediately after rehydration with ORT.[59] Lactose-free or lactose-reduced formulas usually are not necessary.[59] Children should continue their usual diet during episodes of diarrhea with the exception that foods high in simple sugars should be avoided.[59] The BRAT diet (bananas, rice, applesauce, toast and tea) is no longer recommended, as it contains insufficient nutrients and has no benefit over normal feeding.[59]Some probiotics have been shown to be beneficial in reducing both the duration of illness and the frequency of stools.[60][61] They may also be useful in preventing and treating antibiotic associated diarrhea.[62] Fermented milk products (such as yogurt) are similarly beneficial.[63] Zinc supplementation appears to be effective in both treating and preventing diarrhea among children in the developing world.[64]Antiemetics[edit]Antiemetic medications may be helpful for treating vomiting in children. Ondansetron has some utility, with a single dose being associated with less need for intravenous fluids, fewer hospitalizations, and decreased vomiting.[53][65][66][67] Metoclopramide might also be helpful.[67] However, the use of ondansetron might possibly be linked to an increased rate of return to hospital in children.[68] The intravenous preparation of ondansetron may be given orally if clinical judgment warrants.[69] Dimenhydrinate, while reducing vomiting, does not appear to have a significant clinical benefit.[1]Antibiotics[edit]Antibiotics are not usually used for gastroenteritis, although they are sometimes recommended if symptoms are particularly severe[70] or if a susceptible bacterial cause is isolated or suspected.[71] If antibiotics are to be employed, a macrolide (such as azithromycin) is preferred over a fluoroquinolone due to higher rates of resistance to the latter.[19] Pseudomembranous colitis, usually caused by antibiotic use, is managed by discontinuing the causative agent and treating it with either metronidazole or vancomycin.[72] Bacteria and protozoans that are amenable to treatment include Shigella[73] Salmonella typhi,[74] and Giardia species.[36] In those with Giardia species or Entamoeba histolytica, tinidazole treatment is recommended and superior to metronidazole.[36][75] The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of antibiotics in young children who have both bloody diarrhea and fever.[1]Antimotility agents[edit]Antimotility medication has a theoretical risk of causing complications, and although clinical experience has shown this to be unlikely,[43] these drugs are discouraged in people with bloody diarrhea or diarrhea that is complicated by fever.[76] Loperamide, an opioid analogue, is commonly used for the symptomatic treatment of diarrhea.[77] Loperamide is not recommended in children, however, as it may cross the immature blood–brain barrier and cause toxicity. Bismuth subsalicylate, an insoluble complex of trivalent bismuth and salicylate, can be used in mild to moderate cases,[43] but salicylate toxicity is theoretically possible.[1]Epidemiology[edit]Deaths due to diarrhoeal diseases per million persons in 2012 .mw-parser-output .refbegin{font-size:90%;margin-bottom:0.5em}.mw-parser-output .refbegin-hanging-indents>ul{list-style-type:none;margin-left:0}.mw-parser-output .refbegin-hanging-indents>ul>li,.mw-parser-output .refbegin-hanging-indents>dl>dd{margin-left:0;padding-left:3.2em;text-indent:-3.2em;list-style:none}.mw-parser-output .refbegin-100{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .refbegin-columns{margin-top:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .refbegin-columns dl,.mw-parser-output .refbegin-columns ol,.mw-parser-output .refbegin-columns ul{margin-top:0}.mw-parser-output .refbegin-columns li,.mw-parser-output .refbegin-columns dd{page-break-inside:avoid;break-inside:avoid-column}.mw-parser-output .legend{page-break-inside:avoid;break-inside:avoid-column}.mw-parser-output .legend-color{display:inline-block;min-width:1.25em;height:1.25em;line-height:1.25;margin:1px 0;text-align:center;border:1px solid black;background-color:transparent;color:black}.mw-parser-output .legend-text{}0–23–1011–1819–3031–4647–8081–221222–450451–606607–1799Disability-adjusted life year for diarrhea per 100,000inhabitants in 2004. no data ≤less 500 500–1000 1000–1500 1500–2000 2000–2500 2500–3000 3000–3500 3500–4000 4000–4500 4500–5000 5000–6000 ≥6000 It is estimated that there were two billion cases of gastroenteritis that resulted in 1.3million deaths globally in 2015.[6][7] Children and those in the developing world are most commonly affected.[15] As of 2011, in those less than five, there were about 1.7billion cases resulting in 0.7million deaths,[16] with most of these occurring in the world\\'s poorest nations.[17] More than 450,000 of these fatalities are due to rotavirus in children under 5years of age.[10][78] Cholera causes about three to five million cases of disease and kills approximately 100,000 people yearly.[31] In the developing world, children less than two years of age frequently get six or more infections a year that result in significant gastroenteritis.[17] It is less common in adults, partly due to the development of acquired immunity.[18]In 1980, gastroenteritis from all causes caused 4.6million deaths in children, with the majority occurring in the developing world.[72] Death rates were reduced significantly (to approximately 1.5million deaths annually) by the year 2000, largely due to the introduction and widespread use of oral rehydration therapy.[79] In the US, infections causing gastroenteritis are the second most common infection (after the common cold), and they result in between 200 and 375million cases of acute diarrhea[17][18] and approximately ten thousand deaths annually,[17] with 150 to 300 of these deaths in children less than five years of age.[1]History[edit]The first usage of \"gastroenteritis\" was in 1825.[80] Before this time it was commonly known as typhoid fever or \"cholera morbus\", among others, or less specifically as \"griping of the guts\", \"surfeit\", \"flux\", \"colic\", \"bowel complaint\", or any one of a number of other archaic names for acute diarrhea.[81] Cholera morbus is a historical term that was used to refer to gastroenteritis rather than specifically cholera.[82]Society and culture[edit]Gastroenteritis is associated with many colloquial names, including \"Montezuma\\'s revenge\", \"Delhi belly\", \"la turista\", and \"back door sprint\", among others.[17] It has played a role in many military campaigns and is believed to be the origin of the term \"no guts no glory\".[17]Gastroenteritis is the main reason for 3.7million visits to physicians a year in the United States[1] and 3million visits in France.[83] In the United States gastroenteritis as a whole is believed to result in costs of US$23billion per year[84] with that due to rotavirus alone resulting in estimated costs of US$1billion a year.[1]Research[edit]There are a number of vaccines against gastroenteritis in development. For example, vaccines against Shigella and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) are two of the leading bacterial causes of gastroenteritis worldwide.[85][86]Other animals[edit]Many of the same agents cause gastroenteritis in cats and dogs as in humans. The most common organisms are Campylobacter, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens, and Salmonella.[87] A large number of toxic plants may also cause symptoms.[88]Some agents are more specific to a certain species. Transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) occurs in pigs resulting in vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration.[89] It is believed to be introduced to pigs by wild birds and there is no specific treatment available.[90] It is not transmissible to humans.[91]References[edit]^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z aa ab ac ad .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}Singh, Amandeep (July 2010). \"Pediatric Emergency Medicine Practice Acute Gastroenteritis — An Update\".

       "   'text': 'Chronic diarrhea of infancyOther namesToddler\\'s diarrheaSpecialtyPediatricsChronic diarrhea (alternate spelling: diarrhoea) of infancy, also called toddler\\'s diarrhea, is a common condition typically affecting up to 1.7 billion children between ages 6–30 months worldwide every year, usually resolving by age4.[1][2] According to the World Health Organization (WHO), diarrheal disease is the second greatest cause of death in children 5 years and younger. Diarrheal disease takes the lives of 525,000 or more children per year.[2] Diarrhea is characterized as the condition of passing of three or more loose or watery bowel movements within a day sometimes with undigested food visible. Diarrhea is separated into three clinical categories; acute diarrhea may last multiple hours or days, acute bloody diarrhea, also known as dysentery, and finally, chronic or persistent diarrhea which lasts 2–4 weeks or more.[2] There is normal growth with no evidence of malnutrition in the child experiencing persistent diarrhea. In chronic diarrhea there is no evidence of blood in the stool and there is no sign of infection. The condition may be related to irritable bowel syndrome.[1] There are various tests that can be performed to rule out other causes of diarrhea that don\\'t fall under the chronic criteria, including blood test, colonoscopy, and even genetic testing.[3][4] Most acute or severe cases of diarrhea have treatment guidelines revolving around prescription or non prescription (also known as over the counter or OTC) medications based on the cause, but the treatment protocols for chronic diarrhea focus on replenishing the body with lost fluids and electrolytes, because there typically isn\\'t a treatable cause.[5]Contents1 Signs and Symptoms1.1 Complications2 Cause3 Diagnosis3.1 Diagnostic Tests3.1.1 Genetic Testing4 Treatment and Management5 Epidemiology6 ReferencesSigns and Symptoms[edit]Toddler\\'s diarrhea is characterized by three or more watery stools per day that persist for 2–4 weeks or more.[2][6] Newborns and infants may normally have soft and frequent stools; however, any noticeable changes in stool frequency or form (i.e. watery) can indicate toddler\\'s diarrhea.[7] Other symptoms may include chills, fever, abdominal pain or cramping, nausea, and/or vomiting.[6] Undigested food and/or mucus may also be observed in stools.[8] More serious symptoms may include bloody stools, weight loss, greasy stools, and/or severe abdominal pain.[9]Aside from these signs and symptoms, infants and children present as healthy individuals with appropriate weight gain (considering sufficient calorie intake), active lifestyles, and normal appetites.[10][11]Complications[edit]Possible complications associated with toddler\\'s diarrhea include malabsorption and dehydration.Malabsorption affects the small intestine and results in the impaired absorption of important nutrients from an infant or child\\'s diet, leading to malnutrition. Malabsorption is indicated by symptoms of bloating, appetite changes, weight loss, and/or gas.[6]Dehydration occurs when there is not enough fluid intake to compensate for increased loss of fluid and electrolytes that may result from chronic diarrhea.[7] Dehydration is indicated by symptoms of thirst, absence of tears when crying, infrequent urination, dry mouth, and/or decreased energy.[6]Cause[edit]Diarrhea happens when the amount of fluids absorbed in the intestine does not match the amount secreted. The imbalance can be achieved in two ways: an excess of secretion or a lack of absorption. Thus, diarrhea can be categorized into secretory diarrhea, an excess of secretion, or osmotic diarrhea which is a lack of absorption. Usually both categories are present in chronic diarrhea of infants.[12]Secretory diarrhea can be caused by either infectious or non-infectious agents. Infectious agents include bacteria, viruses, and protozoans while non-infectious agents can be hormones, neurotransmitters, cytokines, and others. Osmotic diarrhea occurs when nutrients that are not absorbed exists in the intestines, typically due to damage to the intestines. The nutrients that are unable to be absorbed in the intestines draws water to itself.[12]Some factors that lead to chronic diarrhea of infancy:[9]Underdeveloped digestive system, nutrients do not spend adequate time in the digestive tract for water to be absorbed which leads to diarrhea.[9]Imbalanced Diet - a diet that has excess fiber and/or a lack of fat, fat can slow down the digestion process and prolong the amount of time nutrients spend in the tract which increases absorption. Fiber can lead to diarrhea because it shortens the amount of time food spends in the intestines, decreasing absorption.[9]Inability to absorb carbohydratesThe specific source of chronic diarrhea typically depends on the age of the infant/child. Diarrhea is uncommon for newborns; consequently, its presence in newborns could indicate a congenital disorder which would need hospitalization. Rare causes of chronic diarrhea in young children include a group of genetic mutations known as \"congenital diarrhea and enteropathies\" (CODEs). This group of genetic disorders usually presents in the first weeks of birth as severe and debilitating diarrhea and can lead to malabsorption, growth failure, and difficulty feeding.[13] CODEs are rare genetic changes to a single gene that affects the lining of the intestine or changes to the immune system that also affects the cell function of important nutrient and electrolyte transporters in the intestine such as Cl−/HCO3− mutation.[13]Otherwise, socioeconomic factors and access to treatment/healthcare play a significant part in developing chronic diarrhea as an infant. For instance, leading causes of chronic diarrhea in developing countries are infections of the intestine. In developed countries, chronic diarrhea has a diverse range of causes such as chronic infection of the intestines, autoimmune enteropathy, and inability to absorb nutrients via celiac disease, food sensitivities, etc.[12]From age 0–30 days, typical causes are:[12]Abetalipoproteinemia, a condition caused by a genetic mutation that creates abnormal absorption of fats and some vitamins.[14][15]Acrodermatitis enteropathica, a condition in which the intestine cannot absorb zinc.[16]Autoimmune enteropathy, a rare condition in which the intestines are perceived as a foreign threat by the immune system and are attacked leading to irritation and inflammation.[17][18]Microvillous inclusion disease, a condition caused by a genetic mutation leading to severe diarrhea because intestinal cells did not have normal development and thus the intestines are not able to absorb nutrients properly.[19][20]Congenital chloride diarrhea, a lifelong condition caused by a genetic mutation that leads to diarrhea with a high concentration of chloride.[21]Congenital sodium diarrhea, a genetic disorder caused by mutations in electrolyte transporters that disrupt the transport of Na+ across the intestine and results in high levels of Na+ greater than 145 mM in the stool.[13]Congenital short-bowel syndrome, a condition in which a portion of the small intestine is absent or not functioning properly leading to decreased absorption of both fluids and nutrients.[22]Congenital lactase deficiency, a condition caused by a genetic mutation in which the body cannot digest lactose properly.[23]Glucose-galactose malabsorption, a genetic disorder caused by changes in a protein critical for the transport of glucose and galactose across the intestine which leads to impaired glucose/galactose absorption, dehydration, and severe diarrhea in young children.[13][24] Typically, the severe diarrhea improves with a diet low in glucose/galactose and the tolerability to glucose/galactose improves with age.[13][25]Hirschsprung\\'s disease (HSCR), a gut motility disorder characterized by a lack of nerve cells in the large intestine which are needed to move the stool through the digestive tract.[26][27] In infants, HSCR typically presents when a newborn is unable to pass the first feces, or meconium within 48 hours of birth.[26] Other symptoms include blockage of the intestine, fever, rapid release of stool and flatulence upon rectal examination, and may present with diarrhea in infants.[26][27]Intestinal pseudo-obstruction (IPO), a gut motility disorder characterized by the inability to contract intestinal walls with symptoms similar to intestinal obstruction but lack a distinguishable cause of obstruction.[28][29] Signs and symptoms include abdominal pain, dilated or enlarged bowel, constipation and may include diarrhea.[28] Although rare in infants, IPO is a type of congenital disorder that may present with diarrhea in infants.[30]Primary bile acid malabsorption, a gut defect in the reabsorption of bile acids in the small intestine which results in increased levels of bile acids in the colon leading to watery diarrhea and bloating.[31]Chronic infection of C. difficile, G. lambliaC. difficile - bacteria that can be the source of diarrhea.[32]G. lamblia - a parasite that can be the source diarrhea.[33]From 1–12 months, typical causes of chronic diarrhea are the following:Acrodermatitis enteropathica, a condition in which the intestine cannot absorb zinc.[16]Cystic fibrosis, a condition caused by a genetic mutation that can lead to injury to the body\\'s organs including the lungs and those in the digestive system.[34][35]Apple juice and pear nectar, the digestive tract of children have difficulty absorbing significant quantities of sugars and carbohydrates which certain fruit juices can have.[9][12]Celiac Disease, a disorder in which there is an immune response to eating gluten which can eventually cause damage to the small intestine over time and impedes absorption.[36][37]Food allergy.[12]Most instances of chronic diarrhea in infancy are caused by infectious and post infectious disease of the intestine as well as food sensitivities or allergies.[38]Diagnosis[edit]Diagnosis of toddler\\'s diarrhea involves the evaluation of history of present illness, any relevant past medical history, and physical examination to determine any causative factors to inform treatment regimens and further recommendations.[39]Evaluation of history of present illness includes:[39]Stool characterization (i.e. appearance, consistency, frequency, etc.)Time frame and duration (important for differentiation between acute and chronic diarrhea)Food/drink allergies or restrictions (e.g. lactose intolerance)Medications, especially antibioticsInfection exposure (e.g. travel)Evaluation of past medical history includes:[39]Family historyConditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, cystic fibrosis, and celiac diseasePhysical examination involves:[39]Abdominal examination (tenderness, distention, and/or bowel sounds)Genital examination (rashes, anal fissures, and/or ulcerative lesions)General assessment and vital signs (any signs of dehydration such as tachycardia and low blood pressure)Examination of extremities and head (any signs of dehydration such as dry mucous membranes and skin turgor)Diagnostic Tests[edit]The following tests can also be performed to assist in the diagnosis of toddler\\'s diarrhea and evaluation of any associated complications/underlying conditions:[6][4]Stool tests provide further information about bleeding, infectious agents, and/or anatomical problems.Blood tests allow assessment of inflammatory markers and/or other criterion for causative diseases.X-rays provide evaluations of any problems that may originate in the gastrointestinal tract/liver/etc.Upper endoscopy or colonoscopy allows visualization of the gastrointestinal tract to assess location of inflammation.Breath hydrogen tests are utilized to determine lactose, fructose, and/or sucrose intolerance. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) may also be indicated by this test.Genetic Testing[edit]Most commonly, chronic diarrhea in infants and children are classified as acquired diarrhea, identified with the general diagnostic tests mentioned above. The other classification of chronic diarrhea, congenital diarrheas and enteropathies (CODEs), are rare diagnoses of exclusion. With recent advances in genome sequencing, the addition of targeted genetic testing to diagnostic algorithms has been proposed to allow faster diagnoses and earlier treatment of CODEs.[13] While certain genes and mutations have been associated with various CODEs, further research and studies are necessary to support the role of diagnostic genetic testing.[3]Treatment and Management[edit]According to doctors of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), treating the cause of chronic diarrhea in infants is primarily through diet (e.g. avoiding foods their bodies don\\'t tolerate such as gluten, lactose, fructose, and sucrose).[40][41][42] Dietary fiber and fat can be increased and fluid intake, especially fruit juice intake, decreased. With these considerations, NIDDK doctors recommend that children consume a normal balanced diet based on their age to avoid malnutrition or growth restriction.[1][43]Non-prescription medications such as loperamide are not recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for children below 6 years of age as they don\\'t address the underlying cause of the condition.[39][43] According to Benjamin Ortiz, M.D., a pediatrician in the Food and Drug Administration\\'s Office of Pediatric Therapeutics, bismuth subsalicylate is not recommended in children below 12 years of age because its contents, including magnesium, aluminum, and bismuth, are not readily cleared from their bodies, making them more susceptible to harm.[44]Studies have shown that certain probiotic preparations such as Lactobacillus rhamnosus (a bacterium) and Saccharomyces boulardii (a yeast) may be effective at reducing the duration and severity of diarrhea in acute settings as a result of gastroenteritis, while other studies have found that the use of probiotics doesn\\'t have an effect on the length of diarrhea in toddlers.[45][46][47]While treatments for chronic diarrhea of infancy aren\\'t clear cut, it is crucial to address the complications of dehydration that may arise from chronic diarrhea with the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines recommendation of oral rehydration therapy (ORT).[5] Oral rehydration solution (ORS), recommended by both AAP and the World Health Organization (WHO), must be composed of 50-90mEq/L sodium and 2% glucose or other complex carbohydrates.[39] ORS is easily found in the US because it is available without a prescription. The typical amount of ORS administered is 50mL/kg over a 4 hour time period for mild dehydration and 100mL/kg over a 4 hour time period for moderate dehydration with an extra 10mL/kg for every loose stool. Repeat this administration regimen for as long as the signs and symptoms of dehydration continue.[48] It is important to take measures early on to maintain hydration. Along with ORT, WHO recommends a 10-14 day course of 20mg zinc tablet supplementation, stating it will shorten the length of diarrhea and potentially improving harmful outcomes.[2]The NIDDK recommends a visit to the doctor when a child experiences stools containing pus or blood (black, tarry, or coffee ground-like appearance), signs of dehydration, diarrhea longer that 24 hours, or a fever of 102 degrees or more.[44]Epidemiology[edit]Diarrheal illness in children accounts for 1.5 to 2.5 million deaths per year worldwide.[39] It is responsible for the secondary cause of mortality among children less than 5 years of age surpassing the combined childhood deaths from malaria, measles, and AIDS.[49][50] In 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO)/United Nations International Children\\'s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) reported 2.5 billion cases of diarrhea in children less than 5 years old.[49] More than half of the cases occurred in Africa and South Asia. It is estimated that Africa and South Asia comprise more than 80% of deaths from diarrhea in children.[49] In fact, about 75% of the childhood deaths from diarrhea come from only 15 countries.[49] According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the proportion of deaths attributable to diarrheal illness among children less than 5 years of age was 13.2% in 2002.[51] Half of these childhood deaths were due to chronic diarrheal causes.Worldwide, studies estimate that diarrheal illness affects 3 to 20% of children under the age of 5 with an incidence of 2.7 episodes of diarrhea per child-year.[52][53] Developing nations experience higher burden of disease and mortality from chronic diarrhea in children compared to developed nations.[49] In the United States, it is reported that 15 to 20% of young children have an episode of acute diarrhea each year. Compared to worldwide estimates, the United States has a lower incidence rate of chronic diarrhea in young children reported at 0.18 episodes per child year.[54] In pediatrics, diarrhea is a common complaint making up 9% of U.S. hospital visits for children less than 5 years old.[39] In contrast to resource-poor nations, resource-rich nations such as the United States experience less chronic diarrhea severity. In the United States, approximately a quarter of chronic diarrhea cases in young children seek medical care and less than 1% of cases are hospitalized.[54][55]References[edit]^ a b c .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}Schwab J. \"Toddler\\'s Diarrhea (online course materials)\".

       "   'text': 'Apnea of prematuritySpecialtyPediatricsApnea of prematurity is defined as cessation of breathing by a premature infant that lasts for more than 20 seconds and/or is accompanied by hypoxia or bradycardia. Apnea is traditionally classified as either obstructive, central, or mixed. Obstructive apnea may occur when the infant\\'s neck is hyperflexed or conversely, hyperextended.It may also occur due to low pharyngeal muscle tone or to inflammation of the soft tissues, which can block the flow of air though the pharynx and vocal cords. Central apnea occurs when there is a lack of respiratory effort. This may result from central nervous system immaturity, or from the effects of medications or illness. Many episodes of apnea of prematurity may start as either obstructive or central, but then involve elements of both, becoming mixed in nature.[1]Contents1 Pathophysiology2 Diagnosis3 Treatment3.1 Medications3.2 Respiratory support3.3 Monitoring4 Outcome5 Epidemiology6 References7 External linksPathophysiology[edit]Ventilatory drive is primarily dependent on response to increased levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) and acid in the blood. A secondary stimulus is hypoxia. Responses to these stimuli are impaired in premature infants due to immaturity of specialized regions of the brain that sense these changes.In addition, premature infants have an exaggerated response to laryngeal stimulation (a normal reflex that closes the airway as a protective measure).[1]Diagnosis[edit]Apnea of prematurity can be readily identified from other forms of infant apnea such as obstructive apnea, hypoventilation syndromes, breathing regulation issues during feeding, and reflux associated apnea with an infant pneumogram or infant apnea/sleep study.It has been reported that the incidence of neonatal apnea happens in almost all infants with gestational age of less than 29 weeks or the birth weight of less than 1000g.[2][3][4]Treatment[edit]Medications[edit]Methylxanthines (theophylline and caffeine) have been used for almost three decades to treat apnea of prematurity.[5] Despite this prevalent use, there are concerns of long term negative effects from the use of caffeine.[6] Caffeine and theophylline have similar short-term effects on apnea, but theophylline is associated with higher rates of toxicity.[7]Respiratory support[edit]Simple tactile stimulation by touching the skin or patting the infant may stop an apneic episode by raising the infant\\'s level of alertness.Increasing the environmental oxygen level by placing the infant in a tent or hood with supplemental oxygen can diminish the frequency of AOP, and may also help the infant maintain adequate oxygenation during short episodes of apnea.Increased oxygen at low levels can also be delivered using a nasal cannula, which additionally may provide some stimulation due to the tactile stimulation of the cannula.CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) is sometimes used for apnea when medications and supplemental oxygen are not sufficient.Usually as a last resort, mechanical ventilation is used to support infants whose apnea cannot be controlled sufficiently by other methods and where the potential risk of harm from recurrent hypoxia is felt to outweigh the risks of injury from ventilation.Monitoring[edit]In-hospital monitors in the NICU typically measure respiratory movements, heartrate, and pulse oximetry.Central apnea can be detected quickly since it results in absence of respiratory movements.Obstructive apnea can be detected when the level of oxygen has declined in the blood and/or results in slowing of the heart rate.Home apnea monitors (which must be distinguished from infant monitors that are designed only to allow parents to listen to the infant remotely) most frequently measure only respiratory movements and/or heart rate.They are generally used with premature infants who are otherwise ready for discharge, but who continue to require supplemental oxygen or medication for mild residual AOP.Home apnea monitoring is typically required for 6–12 weeks after discharge.Outcome[edit]Since AOP is fundamentally a problem of the immaturity of the physiological systems of the premature infant, it is a self-limited condition that will resolve when these systems mature.It is unusual for an infant to continue to have significant problems with AOP beyond 43 weeks post-conceptual age.Infants who have had AOP are at increased risk of recurrence of apnea in response to exposure to anesthetic agents, at least until around 52 weeks post-conceptual age.There is no evidence that a history of AOP places an infant at increased risk for SIDS.However, any premature infant (regardless of whether they have had AOP) is at increased risk of SIDS.It is important that other factors related to SIDS risk be avoided (exposure to smoking, prone sleeping, excess bedding materials, etc.)Epidemiology[edit]Apnea of prematurity occurs in at least 85 percent of infants who are born at less than 34 weeks of gestation. The incidence is inversely related to the gestational maturity of the infant, but has considerable individual variability.References[edit]^ a b .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}Martin R.J.;etal.

       "   'text': 'Clinical FeaturesGonzalez et al. (1977) reported 2 families, with surnames beginning with W and T, in which multiple members had severe hypoplastic anemia, congenital anomalies, and leukemia. Important characteristics differentiating this condition from Fanconi anemia (227650) were autosomal dominant inheritance and absence of chromosome breakage. In addition, the congenital anomalies were somewhat different. The W family was ascertained through a 13-year-old girl without congenital anomalies who developed acute lymphocytic leukemia at the age of 11.5 years. Her father had clinodactyly V bilaterally and at 26 years was found to have pancytopenia refractory to treatment and leading to death 1 year later. His oldest brother was born with congenital malformation of the elbow and hands and was healthy until age 38 when he was found to have idiopathic anemia evolving into refractory pancytopenia. He died at 42 years of age. Their mother had died at age 71 of leukemia. The propositus of the T family had malformations of both hands at birth and at 21 months was found to have anemia for which he received transfusions. Several paternal relatives had severe hand anomalies and a history of childhood anemia. The paternal grandfather died at the age of 51 of acute monocytic leukemia. Gonzalez et al. (1977) concluded that some earlier reports of presumed Fanconi anemia actually are instances of the WT syndrome. For example, McDonald and Goldschmidt (1960) reported 3 children and their mother who had severe anemia in childhood. All the children had abnormal thumbs. McDonald and Mibashan (1968) reported that 2 of the children recovered spontaneously from serious hematologic abnormalities.Smith et al. (1987) described a third family. The 13-year-old male proband, referred for evaluation of possible Fanconi anemia, had bilateral absent thumbs with flexion contractures of the fingers, irregular hyperpigmentation, radioulnar synostosis, and bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. The karyotype was 47,XXY; cytogenetic studies using clastogenic agents were negative. Nine other members of the family spanning 3 generations were affected with findings ranging from transient to chronic anemia and/or radial defects of digitalized, hypoplastic or absent thumbs. Of 10 affected individuals, 4 had both hematologic and radiologic abnormalities and 5 had only radial defects.

Additional variable features include hypotonia and retinopathy (summary by Imataka et al., 2013 and Giovannini et al., 2013).Clinical FeaturesIselius et al. (1980) reported a 12-year-old girl who developed seizures at 8 months of age, followed by delayed psychomotor development with mental retardation and poor speech. She had some dysmorphic features, including broad, flat nose, synophrys, narrow palpebral fissures, high-arched palate, and cubitus valgus. She also had microcrania and poorly mineralized long bones and bones of the hand. Cytogenetic analysis showed a ring chromosome 14 that was not present in the mother; genetic material from the father was not available.Schmidt et al. (1981) reported a 35-month-old girl of Puerto Rican descent with delayed psychomotor development, poor speech, and dysmorphic features, including high forehead, narrow biparietal diameter, flat occiput, flat nasal bridge, hypertelorism and downslanting palpebral fissures, epicanthal folds, short thick eyebrows, low-set ears with large lobes, high-arched palate, and short neck. She also had abnormal hypo- and hyperpigmented spots on the body. Neurologic examination showed poor head control and increased muscle tone with hyperreflexia; she later developed poorly controlled generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Cytogenetic studies identified a ring chromosome 14 aberration that was not present in either unaffected parent.Matalon et al. (1990) reported a family in which a mother who was mosaic for a ring chromosome 14 transmitted it to her 2 sons, both of whom had severe mental retardation with poor or absent speech, infantile-onset seizures, and dysmorphic facial features. The mother had borderline normal cognition and mild dysmorphic features, including anteverted nares and downward slant to the eyes. The mother also had a translocation t(14q21q) that was not found in her sons; Matalon et al. (1990) postulated that the translocation contributed to the ring 14 formation.Atchaneeyasakul et al. (1998) reported a patient (S.T.) with microcephaly, mild developmental delay, and chorioretinopathy associated with a ring chromosome 14.Imataka et al. (2013) reported a 5-year-old girl who developed generalized seizures at age 9 months, followed by refractory complex partial seizures. She had delayed development and very mild facial abnormalities, including flat nose, blepharophimosis, and almond-shaped eyes. Brain MRI was normal; EEG showed high-amplitude slow waves with spikes. Chromosome analysis showed ring chromosome 14.Giovannini et al. (2013) retrospectively reviewed the seizure phenotype of 22 patients with r(14) syndrome who ranged in age from 26 months to 22 years. The mean age at seizure onset was 1 year, 2 months, with 11 patients developing seizures before 6 months of age. Seizure type was variable, including generalized, tonic-clonic, myoclonic, clonic, and focal hemiclonic. Eight patients had severe and prolonged seizures resulting in status epilepticus. About half had seizures during sleep or while falling asleep. Most seizures were drug-resistant. Seizure frequency changed during the disease course, and some patients had some drug response. EEG tended to show slow background activity with paroxysmal spike-waves often during sleep. In addition to seizures, common features of these patients included axial hypotonia, microcephaly, and moderate to severe intellectual disability.

       "   'title': 'Wilms tumor',\n",
       "   'text': \"Wilms tumor is a form of kidney cancer that primarily develops in children. Nearly all cases of Wilms tumor are diagnosed before the age of 10, with two-thirds being found before age 5.Wilms tumor is often first noticed because of abdominal swelling or a mass in the kidney that can be felt upon physical examination. Some affected children have abdominal pain, fever, a low number of red blood cells (anemia), blood in the urine (hematuria), or high blood pressure (hypertension). Additional signs of Wilms tumor can include loss of appetite, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, and tiredness (lethargy).Wilms tumor can develop in one or both kidneys. About 5 to 10 percent of affected individuals develop multiple tumors in one or both kidneys. Wilms tumor may spread from the kidneys to other parts of the body (metastasize). In rare cases, Wilms tumor does not involve the kidneys and occurs instead in the genital tract, bladder, abdomen, chest, or lower back. It is unclear how Wilms tumor develops in these tissues.With proper treatment, children with Wilms tumor have a 90 percent survival rate. However, the risk that the cancer will come back (recur) is between 15 and 50 percent, depending on traits of the original tumor. Tumors usually recur in the first 2 years following treatment and develop in the kidneys or other tissues, such as the lungs. Individuals who have had Wilms tumor may experience related health problems or late effects of their treatment in adulthood, such as decreased kidney function, heart disease, and development of additional cancers.FrequencyWilms tumor is the most common kidney cancer in children. In Europe and North America, Wilms tumor affects 1 in 10,000 children. In the United States, 500 children develop Wilms tumor each year. The incidence of Wilms tumor seems to vary among populations, with African Americans having a higher-than-average risk of developing this cancer and Asians having a lower-than-average risk.Wilms tumor rarely develops in adults; only about 300 such cases have been described.CausesChanges in any of several genes are involved in the formation of Wilms tumor. Wilms tumor is often associated with mutations in the WT1 gene, CTNNB1 gene, or AMER1 gene. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that regulate gene activity and promote the growth and division (proliferation) of cells. WT1, CTNNB1, and AMER1 gene mutations all lead to the unchecked proliferation of cells, allowing tumor development.Changes on the short (p) arm of chromosome 11 are also associated with developing Wilms tumor. Two genes in this area, IGF2 and H19, are either turned on or off depending on whether the copy of the gene was inherited from the mother or the father. This parent-specific difference in gene activation is a phenomenon called genomic imprinting. In some cases of Wilms tumor, abnormalities in the process of genomic imprinting on chromosome 11 lead to a loss of H19 gene activity and increased activity of the IGF2 gene in kidney cells. The resulting loss of H19 gene activity, which normally restrains cell growth, and increase in IGF2 gene activity, which promotes cell growth, together lead to uncontrolled cell growth and tumor development in people with Wilms tumor.In most cases of Wilms tumors involving one kidney and nearly all cases involving both kidneys, the tumors are thought to arise from immature kidney tissue that never developed properly. These immature tissues are known as nephrogenic rests. It is likely that genetic changes are involved in the presence of nephrogenic rests and that additional genetic changes trigger nephrogenic rests to develop into a tumor.Genetic conditions that share a genetic cause with Wilms tumor can also have this cancer as a feature. These conditions include WAGR syndrome, Denys-Drash syndrome, and Frasier syndrome, which are caused by mutations in the WT1 gene. Wilms tumor has also been seen in individuals with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, which can be caused by changes in the genomic imprinting of the IGF2 and H19 genes. Wilms tumor can be a feature of other genetic conditions caused by mutations in other genes.Many children with Wilms tumor do not have identified mutations in any of the known genes. In these cases, the cause of the condition is unknown. It is likely that other, unknown genes are also associated with the development of Wilms tumor.Learn more about the genes associated with Wilms tumorAMER1CTNNB1H19IGF2TP53WT1Additional Information from NCBI Gene:DGCR8DROSHAPOU6F2RESTInheritance PatternMost cases of Wilms tumor are not caused by inherited genetic factors and do not cluster in families. Approximately 90 percent of these cancers are due to somatic mutations, which means that the mutations are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in the tumor cells.Mutations that are present in cells throughout the body (called germline mutations) are responsible for the remaining 10 percent of Wilms tumor cases and cause either Wilms tumor without any other signs or symptoms or syndromes in which Wilms tumor is one of multiple features. These cases follow autosomal dominant inheritance, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell can cause a Wilms tumor-related syndrome or increase a person's chance of developing the cancer alone. Most of these cases result from new (de novo) mutations in the gene that occur during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) or in early embryonic development.The AMER1 gene is located on the X chromosome (one of the two sex chromosomes), so when Wilms tumor is caused by mutations in this gene, the condition follows an X-linked dominant pattern. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation in one of the two copies of the gene in each cell is sufficient to increase a person's chance of developing cancer. In males (who have only one X chromosome), a mutation in the only copy of the gene in each cell increases their cancer risk.In many cases, the genetic basis for Wilms tumor and the mechanism of inheritance are unclear.\"},\n",

All developed intractable seizures between 2 and 6 months of age. EEG showed multifocal epileptic activity in all, with 1 patient having at least 1 episode of hypsarrhythmia. In the first months of life, all girls showed delayed psychomotor development and cortical visual impairment or blindness. They had either poor speech or lack of speech and difficulties in activities of daily living, such as self-feeding. Dysmorphic features in the sisters included low anterior hairline, periorbital fullness, telecanthus, and broad nasal bridge with anteverted nares. The unrelated girl had bitemporal narrowing, low anterior hairline, thick and duplicated eyebrows, synophrys, long eyelashes, enophthalmia, a large prominent nasal root with bulbous tip, short philtrum, full lips, and abnormal ears. Brain imaging in 2 unrelated girls showed an abnormally marked pontobulbar sulcus with mild pontine hypoplasia and T2-weighted white matter abnormalities with atrophy in the occipital white and gray matter. All also had a thin corpus callosum.InheritanceThe transmission pattern of EIEE23 in the families reported by Perrault et al. (2014) was consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance.Molecular GeneticsIn 3 girls from 2 unrelated families with early infantile epileptic encephalopathy, Perrault et al. (2014) identified 4 different compound heterozygous truncating mutations in the DOCK7 gene (615730.0001-615730.0004). The mutations were found by exome sequencing and were predicted to result in a loss of protein function. Perrault et al. (2014) noted that since DOCK7 plays a role in neurogenesis, the regulation of neuronal polarity, and the development of GABAergic neurons, disruption of DOCK7 function could result in a neurodevelopmental disorder, as observed in their patients.INHERITANCE- Autosomal recessiveHEAD & NECKFace- Periorbital fullness- Bitemporal narrowing- Short philtrumEars- Abnormally shaped earsEyes- Cortical visual impairment- Cortical blindness- Telecanthus- Thick eyebrowsNose- Large nasal root- Broad nasal tip- Anteverted naresMouth- Full lipsSKIN, NAILS, & HAIRHair- Low anterior hairlineNEUROLOGICCentral Nervous System- Epileptic encephalopathy- Delayed psychomotor development- Regression of early motor skills- Seizures, intractable- Hypsarrhythmia- Abnormally marked pontobulbar sulcus- Pontine hypoplasia, mild- Abnormal T2-weighted signals in the occipital white and gray matter- Occipital lobe atrophy- Thin corpus callosumMISCELLANEOUS- Onset in infancy- Three girls from 2 unrelated families have been reported (last curated June 2014)MOLECULAR BASIS- Caused by mutation in the dedicator of cytokinesis 7 gene (DOCK7,615730.0001)▲Close'},\n",

       "   'text': 'Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) is an inherited condition characterized by recurrent episodes of fever. Episodes can begin at any age but most often begin in early childhood. Fevers typically last about 3 weeks but can last from a few days to a few months. The amount of time between episodes may vary from weeks to years. Episodes usually occur spontaneously, but are sometimes brought on by a variety of triggers (such as injury, infection, or stress). Symptoms during fever episodes may include abdominal, muscle or joint pains; skin rashes (usually on the limbs); puffiness around the eyes; and inflammation in various areas of the body. Some people develop amyloidosis. TRAPS is caused by mutations in the TNFRSF1A gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Treatment may include systemic corticosteroids at the beginning of an episode to reduce its severity and duration.'},\n",

Brain MRI revealed pronounced atrophy of the cerebellum and brainstem. Speech and cognition improved over the next several years, but mild hypotonia and ataxia persisted. Biochemical analysis showed decreased N-glycosylation of serum transferrin and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein, as well as decreased O-glycosylation of apolipoprotein C-III (APOC3; 107720). Retrograde Golgi-to-endoplasmic reticulum trafficking was markedly delayed in the patient fibroblasts upon brefeldin-A treatment, which is a hallmark of COG deficiency. The trafficking delay could be restored to normal values by expressing a wildtype COG5 cDNA in the patient cells. Paesold-Burda et al.

       "   'text': 'Alternating hemiplegia of childhood (AHC)is a neurological disorder that usually affects children before 18 months of age.Classic AHCcauses recurrent episodes of paralysis (hemiplegia)that involve one or both sides of the body, multiple limbs, or a single limb.The paralysis may affect different parts of the body at different times and may be brief or last for several days. A characteristic feature of AHC is that symptoms disappear during sleep andreturn upon waking. Many affected children display some degree of developmental delay, abnormal eye (oculomotor) movements, uncontrolled limbmovements (including ataxia, dystonia, andchoreoathetosis)andseizures.  The majorityof casesofAHC are caused by a new change (called amutationor pathogenic variant) in theATP1A3gene that is not inherited. Thus, most patients with AHC do not have a family history of the disorder. A small number of cases of AHC are caused by changes in theATP1A2gene. When this condition does run in families, it follows anautosomal dominantpattern of inheritance.Treatment is limited to therapies that can help reduce the severity and duration of symptoms.'},\n",

       "   'text': 'Postoperative nausea and vomitingSpecialtyAnesthesiaPostoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is the phenomenon of nausea, vomiting, or retching experienced by a patient in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) or within 24 hours following a surgical procedure. It is an unpleasant complication that affects about 10% of the population undergoing general anaesthesia each year.Contents1 Cause1.1 Risk factors2 Management2.1 Preoperative fasting2.2 Medications[4]2.3 Alternative medicine3 Epidemiology4 References5 Further reading6 External linksCause[edit]Emetogenic drugs commonly used in anaesthesia include nitrous oxide, physostigmine, and opioids. The intravenous anaesthetic propofol is currently the least emetogenic general anaesthetic. These medications are thought to stimulate the chemoreceptor trigger zone. This area is on the floor of the fourth ventricle and is effectively outside of the blood-brain barrier, which makes it incredibly sensitive to toxin and pharmacological stimulation. Several neurotransmitters are known, such as histamine, dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, and the more recently discovered neurokinin-1 (substance P).Risk factors[edit]A 2008 study compared 121 Japanese patients who experienced PONV after being given the general anesthetic propofol to 790 people who were free of postoperative nausea after receiving it. Those with a G at both copies of rs1800497 were 1.6 times more likely to experience PONV within six hours of surgery compared to those with the AG or AA genotypes, but they were not significantly more likely to experience PONV more than six hours after surgery.[1]PONV results from patient, surgical, and anesthetic factors.Surgical factors that confer increased risk for PONV include procedures of increased length and gynecological, abdominal, laparoscopicand ENT procedures, and strabismus procedures in children.Anesthetic risk factors include the use of volatile anesthetics, nitrous oxide (N2O), opioids, and longer duration of anesthesia.Patient factors that confer increased risk for PONV include female gender, obesity, age less than 16 years, past history of motion sickness or chemotherapy-induced nausea, high levels of preoperative anxiety, and patients with history of PONV.Smokers and the elderly often have a decreased risk for PONV.A risk-stratification method created by Apfel et al has been developed to determine a patient\\'s risk for PONV. The presence of 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 of any of the following risk factors corresponds to a PONV respective risk of 10, 20, 40, 60, and 80%.[2]- Female gender- Non-smoking- History of PONV or motion sickness- Expectant use of postoperative opioid medicationsManagement[edit]Becausecurrently no single antiemetic available is especially effective on its own, experts recommend a multimodal approach. Anesthetic strategies to prevent vomiting include using regional anesthesia whenever possible and avoiding medications that cause vomiting. Medications to treat and prevent PONV are limited by both cost and the adverse effects. People with risk factors likely warrant preventive medication, whereas a \"wait and see\" strategy is appropriate for those without risk factors.Preoperative fasting[edit]Fasting guidelines often restrict the intake of any oral fluid 2-6 hours preoperatively, but in a large retrospective analysis in Torbay Hospital, unrestricted clear oral fluids until transfer to theatre could significantly reduce the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting without an increased risk in the adverse outcomes for which such conservative guidance exists.[3]Medications[4][edit]A multimodal approach to treating a patient with PONV can be efficacious. Numerous patient factors and medication adverse effects must be taken into consideration when selecting a treatment regimen.Serotonin (5-HT3) receptor antagonists can be administered as a single dose at the end of surgery. Adverse effects include prolongation of the QT interval on electrocardiogram (EKG). Medications include ondansetron, granisetron, and dolasetron.Anticholinergics can be used as a long-acting patch placed behind the patient\\'s ear. Adverse effects include dry mouth and blurry vision. Care must be taken when handling the patch, as transfer of medication to the eye can induce pupillary dilation. Avoid use in elderly patients. Medications include scopolamine.Glucocorticoids have direct antiemetic effects and can reduce need for postoperative opioids. Adverse effects include a transient increase in serum glucose level, and poor wound healing (controversial).Medications include dexamethasone.Butyrophenones are typically administered as a single injection at the end of surgery. Adverse effects include prolongation of the QT interval on EKG.Medications include droperidol and haloperidol.Phenothiazines are particularly effective in treating opioid-induced PONV. Adverse effects are dose-dependent and include sedation and extrapyramidal symptoms.Medications include promethazine and prochlorperazine.Neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor antagonists prevent an emetic signal from being transmitted.Medications include aprepitant and rolapitant.Histamine receptor antagonists can be administered by multiple routes, including orally, intramuscularly, or rectally. Adverse effects include dry mouth, sedation, and urinary retention.Medications include dimenhydrinate and diphenhydramine.Propofol, an anesthetic medication, confers its own antiemetic properties.Alternative medicine[edit]In conjunction with antiemetic medications, at least one study has found that application to the pericardium meridian 6 acupressure point produced a positive effect in relieving PONV.[5] Another study found no statistically significant difference.[6] The two general types of alternative pressure therapy are sham acupressure and the use of the P6 point. A 2015 study foundno significant difference between the use of either therapy in the treatment or prevention of PONV. In a review of 59 studies, both therapies significantly affected the nausea aspect, but had no significant effect on vomiting.Cannabinoids have also been used for treatment of PONV, but its safety and efficacy are controversial.Epidemiology[edit]Typically, the incidence of nausea or vomiting after general anesthesia ranges between 25 and 30%.[7] Nausea and vomiting can be extremely distressing for patients, and so is one of their major concerns.[8] Vomiting has been associated with major complications, such as pulmonary aspiration of gastric content, and might endanger surgical outcomes after certain procedures, for example after maxillofacial surgery with wired jaws. Nausea and vomiting can delay discharge, and about 1% of patients scheduled for day surgery require unanticipated overnight admission because of uncontrolled PONV.References[edit]^ [1]^ Apfel CC, Läärä E, Koivuranta M, et al.

       "   'title': 'Sporadic hemiplegic migraine',\n",
       "   'text': 'Sporadic hemiplegic migraine is a rare form of migraine headache. Migraines typically cause intense, throbbing pain in one area of the head. Some people with migraines also experience nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light and sound. These recurrent headaches typically begin in childhood or adolescence and can be triggered by certain foods, emotional stress, and minor head trauma. Each headache may last from a few hours to a few days.In sporadic hemiplegic migraine and some other types of migraine, a pattern of neurological symptoms called an aura occurs before onset of the headache. An aura commonly includes temporary visual changes such as blind spots (scotomas), flashing lights, zig-zagging lines, and double vision. In people with sporadic hemiplegic migraine, auras are also characterized by temporary numbness or weakness, often affecting one side of the body (hemiparesis). Additional features of an aura can include difficulty with speech, confusion, and drowsiness. An aura typically develops gradually over a few minutes and lasts about an hour.Some people with sporadic hemiplegic migraine experience unusually severe migraine episodes. These episodes can include fever, prolonged weakness, seizures, and coma. Although most people with sporadic hemiplegic migraine recover completely between episodes, neurological symptoms such as memory loss and problems with attention can last for weeks or months. Some affected individuals develop mild but permanent difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia), which may worsen with time, and rapid, involuntary eye movements called nystagmus. Mild to severe intellectual disability has been reported in some people with sporadic hemiplegic migraine.FrequencyThe worldwide prevalence of sporadic hemiplegic migraine is unknown. Studies suggest that in Denmark about 1 in 10,000 people have hemiplegic migraine and that the condition occurs equally in families with multiple affected individuals (familial hemiplegic migraine) and in individuals with no family history of the condition (sporadic hemiplegic migraine).CausesMutations in the ATP1A2 and CACNA1A genes have been found to cause sporadic hemiplegic migraine. The proteins produced from these genes transport charged atoms (ions) across cell membranes. The movement of these ions is critical for normal signaling between nerve cells (neurons) in the brain and other parts of the nervous system. Signaling between neurons relies on chemicals called neurotransmitters, which are released from one neuron and taken up by neighboring neurons. Mutations in the ATP1A2 and CACNA1A genes disrupt the transport of ions in neurons, which is thought to impair the normal release and uptake of certain neurotransmitters in the brain. The resulting abnormal signaling may lead to the severe headaches and auras characteristic of sporadic hemiplegic migraine.Many people with sporadic hemiplegic migraine do not have a mutation in one of the known genes. Researchers believe that mutations in other genes are also involved in the condition, although these genes have not been identified.There is little evidence that mutations in the CACNA1A and ATP1A2 genes play a role in common migraines, which affect millions of people each year. Researchers are searching for additional genetic changes that may underlie rare types of migraine, such as sporadic hemiplegic migraine, as well as the more common forms of migraine.Learn more about the genes associated with Sporadic hemiplegic migraineATP1A2CACNA1AInheritance PatternSporadic means that the condition occurs in individuals with no history of the disorder in their family. While most cases result from new (de novo) mutations that likely occur during early embryonic development, some affected individuals inherit the genetic change that causes the condition from an unaffected parent. (When some people with the mutation have no signs and symptoms of the disorder, the condition is said to have reduced penetrance.) Although family members of an affected individual do not have sporadic hemiplegic migraine, some experience migraine headaches without hemiparesis. A related condition, familial hemiplegic migraine, has signs and symptoms identical to those in sporadic hemiplegic migraine but occurs in multiple members of a family.'},\n",

       "   'title': 'Mevalonate kinase deficiency',\n",
       "   'text': \"Mevalonate kinase deficiency is a condition characterized by recurrent episodes of fever, which typically begin during infancy. Each episode of fever lasts about 3 to 6 days, and the frequency of the episodes varies among affected individuals. In childhood the fevers seem to be more frequent, occurring as often as 25 times a year, but as the individual gets older the episodes occur less often.Mevalonate kinase deficiency has additional signs and symptoms, and the severity depends on the type of the condition. There are two types of mevalonate kinase deficiency: a less severe type called hyperimmunoglobulinemia D syndrome (HIDS) and a more severe type called mevalonic aciduria (MVA).During episodes of fever, people with HIDS typically have enlargement of the lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy), abdominal pain, joint pain, diarrhea, skin rashes, and headache. Occasionally they will have painful sores called aphthous ulcers around their mouth. In females, these may also occur around the vagina. Rarely, people with HIDS develop a buildup of protein deposits (amyloidosis) in the kidneys that can lead to kidney failure. Fever episodes in individuals with HIDS can be triggered by vaccinations, surgery, injury, or stress. Most people with HIDS have abnormally high levels of immune system proteins called immunoglobulin D (IgD) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) in the blood. It is unclear why some people with HIDS have high levels of IgD and IgA and some do not. Elevated levels of these immunoglobulins do not appear to cause any signs or symptoms. Individuals with HIDS do not have any signs and symptoms of the condition between fever episodes and typically have a normal life expectancy.People with MVA have signs and symptoms of the condition at all times, not just during episodes of fever. Affected children have developmental delay, problems with movement and balance (ataxia), recurrent seizures (epilepsy), progressive problems with vision, and failure to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive). Individuals with MVA typically have an unusually small, elongated head. In childhood or adolescence, affected individuals may develop eye problems such as inflammation of the eye (uveitis), a blue tint in the white part of the eye (blue sclera), an eye disorder called retinitis pigmentosa that causes vision loss, or clouding of the lens of the eye (cataracts). Affected adults may have short stature and may develop muscle weakness (myopathy) later in life. During fever episodes, people with MVA may have an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), lymphadenopathy, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and skin rashes. Children with MVA who are severely affected with multiple problems maylive only into early childhood; mildly affected individuals may have a normal life expectancy.FrequencyMore than 200 people with mevalonate kinase deficiency have been reported worldwide; the majority of these individuals have HIDS.CausesMutations in the MVK gene cause mevalonate kinase deficiency. The MVK gene provides instructions for making the mevalonate kinase enzyme. This enzyme is involved in the production of cholesterol, which is later converted into steroid hormones and bile acids. Steroid hormones are needed for normal development and reproduction, and bile acids are used to digest fats. Mevalonate kinase also helps to produce other substances that are necessary for certain cellular functions, such as cell growth, cell maturation (differentiation), formation of the cell's structural framework (the cytoskeleton), gene activity (expression), and protein production and modification.Most MVK gene mutations that cause mevalonate kinase deficiency result in an enzyme that is unstable and folded into an incorrect 3-dimensional shape, leading to a reduction of mevalonate kinase enzyme activity. Despite this shortage (deficiency) of mevalonate kinase activity, people with mevalonate kinase deficiency typically have normal production of cholesterol, steroid hormones, and bile acids.It is unclear how a lack of mevalonate kinase activity causes the signs and symptoms of this condition. Some researchers believe the features may be due to a buildup of mevalonic acid, the substance that mevalonate kinase normally acts on. Other researchers think that a shortage of the substances produced from mevalonic acid, such as those substances necessary for certain cellular functions, causes the fever episodes and other features of this condition.The severity of the enzyme deficiency determines the severity of the condition. People who have approximately 1 to 20 percent of normal mevalonate kinase activity typically develop HIDS. Individuals who have less than 1 percent of normal enzyme activity usually develop MVA.Learn more about the gene associated with Mevalonate kinase deficiencyMVKInheritance PatternThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\"},\n",

       "   'text': 'Iron poisoningOther namesiron toxicity, iron overdoseIron poisoning typically occurs from ingestion of excess iron that results in acute toxicity.[1] Mild symptoms which occur within hours include vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and drowsiness.[2] In more severe cases, symptoms can include tachypnea, low blood pressure, seizures, or coma.[2] If left untreated, iron poisoning can lead to multi-organ failure resulting in permanent organ damage or death.[3] Iron is available over the counter as a single entity supplement in an iron salt form or in combination with vitamin supplements and is commonly used in the treatment of anemias.[3][2] Overdoses on iron can be categorized as unintentional ingestion which is predominantly associated with children or intentional ingestion involving suicide attempts in adults.[1] Unintentional ingestion of iron containing drug products are a major cause of mortality in children under the age of 6 years old in the United States.[1] As a response, in 1997 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) implemented a regulation requiring warning labels and unit dose packaging for products containing more than 30mg of elemental iron per dose.[4]The diagnosis of iron poisoning is based on clinical presentation including laboratory tests for serum iron concentrations and metabolic acidosis along with physical examination.[4] Treatment for iron poisoning involves providing fluid replacement, gastrointestinal decontamination, administering deferoxamine intravenously, liver transplants, and monitoring the patient\\'s condition.[4] The degree of intervention required depends on whether the patient is at risk for serious toxicity.[4]Contents1 Signs and symptoms2 Cause2.1 Toxic dose3 Diagnosis4 Treatment5 See also6 References7 External linksSigns and symptoms[edit]Clinical presentation of serious toxicity from iron poisoning in the absence of treatment progresses in 5 stages: the gastrointestinal (GI) phase, latent phase, shock and metabolic acidosis phase, hepatotoxicity stage, and bowel obstruction due to scarring.[2] The first indication of iron poisoning occurs within the first 6 hours upon ingestion involving gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms including abdominal pain accompanied by nausea and vomiting or bloody vomiting. After the first stage, the latent phase occurs where symptoms resolve and there is an apparent improvement in the patient\\'s condition.[2] Following this stage, more severe symptoms may develop 6 to 72 hours post-ingestion including low blood pressure, fever, bleeding, jaundice, seizures, hypovolemic shock from fluid and blood loss.[4] During this stage, metabolic acidosis may also develop damaging internal organs such as the brain and liver.[4] In the fourth stage taking place 2 to 5 days after ingestion, mortality from liver failure, shock, blood loss and blood-clotting abnormalities can occur.[2] Patient\\'s who survive iron poisoning progress to the fifth stage 2 to 8 weeks following ingestion and experience scarring of the GI mucosal lining resulting in bowel obstruction.[1] In mild to moderate cases, patient\\'s may be asymptomatic or only experience mild symptoms in the first stage without progressing to the later stages.[4]Cause[edit]Main article: IronIn nature, iron is usually found in its oxidized form, iron (III) oxide, which is insoluble. Ferrous iron, iron (II), is soluble and its toxicity varies, largely with the integrity of the gastrointestinal lining. Iron supplements are typically used to treat anemia.Modalities include: diet, parasite control,[5] vitamin A, riboflavin (B2),[6] vitamin C (for absorption), folate(B9), vitamin B12 and multivitamin-multimineral supplements,[7] with or without iron; potentially avoiding the use of iron only supplements.[8]Toxic dose[edit]The amount of iron ingested may give a clue to potential toxicity. The therapeutic dose for iron deficiency anemia is 3–6mg/kg/day. Toxic effects begin to occur at doses above 10–20mg/kg of elemental iron. Ingestions of more than 50mg/kg of elemental iron are associated with severe toxicity.[9]A 325-mg tablet of ferrous sulfate heptahydrate has 65mg (20%) of elemental ironA 325-mg tablet of ferrous gluconate has 39mg (12%) of elemental ironA 325-mg tablet of ferrous fumarate has 107.25mg (33%) of elemental iron200mg ferrous sulfate, dried, has 65mg (33%) of elemental ironIn terms of blood values, iron levels above 350–500 μg/dL are considered toxic, and levels over 1000μg/dL indicate severe iron poisoning.[10]Diagnosis[edit]A detailed history of the ingestion, especially the number of pillstaken, can be vital. Diagnosis of iron poisoning can be made in the absence of a specific history by clinical judgment, abdominal imaging, and lab assessment. Radioopaque tablets in the stomach on imaging may support a diagnosis of accidental or intentional ingestion of iron tablets. Excessive iron is toxic to the gastrointestinal mucosal, causing abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and bleeding (hematemesis/melena). Vomitus and/or stool may appear black or green from disintegrating iron tablets. Anion gap metabolic acidosis may be present and results from hydrogen ion production during iron absorption and increased lactic acid production due to hypoperfusion/shock. Serum iron levels can be tested and are useful regarding the administration of iron-binding ligands such as deferoxamine. Clinic presentation in the absence of treatment follows in stages and is dose dependent (how much iron was taken):[11][12]StageTime Post IngestionSignsSymptoms11–6 hoursVomiting, diarrhea, GI bleeding, circulatory shock from hemorrhage and vasodilationAbdominal pain26–12 hoursPossible resolution of some signs based on treatment and dosage of poisoningResolution of symptoms (considered a dangerous period if severe poisoning but if mild then may indicate a true turning point)312–36 hoursMetabolic acidosis, circulatory collapse, hepatic failureRenal failureD.I.C.Neurologic decline42–6 weeksSigns of fibrosis at the pyloric region and elsewhere in the intestine with concomitant stenosis (narrowing)Treatment[edit]The first-line treatment of acute iron poisoning is aggressive volume resuscitation. Excessive iron is treated with deferoxamine, a chelating agent that binds free iron, forming a complex that can be renally excreted. Later stage treatment consists of cleaning the iron from the blood, using a chelating agent such as deferoxamine.If this fails then dialysis is the next step.See also[edit]OvernutritionReferences[edit]^ a b c d .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}Yuen, Ho-Wang; Becker, Wenxia (2020), \"Iron Toxicity\", StatPearls, Treasure Island (FL): StatPearls Publishing, PMID29083637, retrieved 2020-12-30^ a b c d e f \"Iron Poisoning - Injuries and Poisoning\".

       "   'title': 'Lennox-Gastaut syndrome',\n",
       "   'text': \"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is a severe condition characterized by recurrent seizures (epilepsy) that begin early in life. Affected individuals have multiple types of seizures, a particular pattern of brain activity (called slow spike-and-wave) measured by a test called an electroencephalogram (EEG), and impaired mental abilities.In Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, epilepsy begins in early childhood, usually between ages 3 and 5. The most common seizure type is tonic seizures, which cause the muscles to stiffen (contract) uncontrollably. These seizures typically occur during sleep; they may also occur during wakefulness and cause sudden falls. Also common are atypical absence seizures, which cause a very brief partial or complete loss of consciousness. Additionally, many affected individuals have episodes called drop attacks, which cause sudden falls that can result in serious or life-threatening injuries. Drop attacks may be caused by sudden loss of muscle tone (described as atonic) or by abnormal muscle contraction (described as tonic). Other types of seizures have been reported less frequently in people with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome often do not respond well to therapy with anti-epileptic medications.Although each seizure episode associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is usually brief, more than two-thirds of affected individuals experience prolonged periods of seizure activity (known as status epilepticus) or episodes of many seizures that occur in a cluster.Most children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome have intellectual disability or learning problems even before seizures begin. These problems may worsen over time, particularly if seizures are very frequent or severe. Some affected children develop additional neurological abnormalities and behavioral problems. Many also have delayed development of motor skills such as sitting and crawling. As a result of their seizures and intellectual disability, most people with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome require help with the usual activities of daily living. However, a small percentage of affected adults live independently.People with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome have a higher risk of death than their peers of the same age. Although the increased risk is not fully understood, it is partly due to poorly controlled seizures and injuries from falls.FrequencyLennox-Gastaut syndrome affects an estimated 1 to 2 per million people. This condition accounts for less than 5 percent of all cases of childhood epilepsy. For unknown reasons, it appears to be more common in males than in females.CausesLennox-Gastaut syndrome can have many different causes. The disorder likely has a genetic component, although the specific genetic factors are not well understood.Most cases of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome are caused by an existing neurological abnormality. These cases can be associated with brain injuries that occur before or during birth, problems with blood flow in the developing brain, brain infections, or other disorders affecting the nervous system. The condition can also result from brain malformations such as forms of cortical dysplasia, which are abnormalities in the outer surface of the brain (cerebral cortex). Many people with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome have a history of epilepsy beginning in infancy (infantile spasms) or a related condition called West syndrome before developing the features of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.In addition, mutations in several genes have been associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, each in a small number of affected individuals. These genes are involved in the function of nerve cells in the brain, but it is unclear how changes in them contribute to the development of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. The condition can also occur as part of a genetic disorder such as tuberous sclerosis complex.In about 10 percent of affected individuals, the cause of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is unknown. These individuals have no history of seizures, neurological problems, or delayed development.Learn more about the genes associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndromeCHD2FOXG1SCN1ASCN8ASTXBP1Additional Information from NCBI Gene:ALG13DNM1GABRB3Inheritance PatternMost cases of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome are sporadic, which means they occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. When Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is associated with a genetic change, the mutation is usually not inherited but occurs as a random (de novo) event during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) in an affected person's parent or in early embryonic development. However, 3 to 30 percent of people with this condition have a family history of some type of epilepsy, indicating that inherited genetic factors may play a role in some cases of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.\"},\n",

       "   'title': 'Citrullinemia',\n",
       "   'text': 'Citrullinemia is an inherited disorder that causes ammonia and other toxic substances to accumulate in the blood. Two types of citrullinemia have been described; they have different signs and symptoms and are caused by mutations in different genes.Type I citrullinemia (also known as classic citrullinemia) usually becomes evident in the first few days of life. Affected infants typically appear normal at birth, but as ammonia builds up, they experience a progressive lack of energy (lethargy), poor feeding, vomiting, seizures, and loss of consciousness. Some affected individuals develop serious liver problems. The health problems associated with type I citrullinemia are life-threatening in many cases. Less commonly, a milder form of type I citrullinemia can develop later in childhood or adulthood. This later-onset form is associated with intense headaches, blind spots (scotomas), problems with balance and muscle coordination (ataxia), and lethargy. Some people with gene mutations that cause type I citrullinemia never experience signs and symptoms of the disorder.Type II citrullinemia chiefly affects the nervous system, causing confusion, restlessness, memory loss, abnormal behaviors (such as aggression, irritability, and hyperactivity), seizures, and coma. Affected individuals often have specific food preferences, preferring protein-rich and fatty foods and avoiding carbohydrate-rich foods. The signs and symptoms of this disorder typically appear during adulthood (adult-onset) and can be triggered by certain medications, infections, surgery, and alcohol intake. These signs and symptoms can be life-threatening in people with adult-onset type II citrullinemia.Adult-onset type II citrullinemia may also develop in people who as infants had a liver disorder called neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency (NICCD). This liver condition is also known as neonatal-onset type II citrullinemia. NICCD blocks the flow of bile (a digestive fluid produced by the liver) and prevents the body from processing certain nutrients properly. In many cases, the signs and symptoms of NICCD go away within a year. In rare cases, affected individuals develop other signs and symptoms in early childhood after seeming to recover from NICCD, including delayed growth, extreme tiredness (fatigue), specific food preferences (mentioned above), and abnormal amounts of fats (lipids) in the blood (dyslipidemia). This condition is known as failure to thrive and dyslipidemia caused by citrin deficiency (FTTDCD). Years or even decades later, some people with NICCD or FTTDCD develop the features of adult-onset type II citrullinemia.FrequencyType I citrullinemia is the most common form of the disorder, affecting about 1 in 57,000 people worldwide. Type II citrullinemia is found primarily in the Japanese population, where it occurs in an estimated 1 in 100,000 to 230,000 individuals. Type II also has been reported in other populations, including other people from East Asia, the Middle East, the United States, and the United Kingdom.CausesMutations in the ASS1 and SLC25A13 genes cause citrullinemia. The proteins produced from these genes play roles in the urea cycle. The urea cycle is a sequence of chemical reactions that takes place in liver cells. These reactions process excess nitrogen that is generated when protein is used by the body. The excess nitrogen is used to make a compound called urea, which is excreted in urine.Mutations in the ASS1 gene cause type I citrullinemia. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme, argininosuccinate synthase 1, that is responsible for one step of the urea cycle. Mutations in the ASS1 gene reduce the activity of the enzyme, which disrupts the urea cycle and prevents the body from processing nitrogen effectively. Excess nitrogen (in the form of ammonia) and other byproducts of the urea cycle accumulate in the bloodstream. Ammonia is particularly toxic to the nervous system, which helps explain the neurologic symptoms (such as lethargy, seizures, and ataxia) that are often seen in type I citrullinemia.Mutations in the SLC25A13 gene are responsible for adult-onset type II citrullinemia, NICCD, and FTTDCD. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called citrin. Within cells, citrin helps transport molecules used in the production and breakdown of simple sugars, the production of proteins, and the urea cycle. Molecules transported by citrin are also involved in making nucleotides, which are the building blocks of DNA and its chemical cousin, RNA. Mutations in the SLC25A13 gene typically prevent cells from making any functional citrin, which inhibits the urea cycle and disrupts the production of proteins and nucleotides. The resulting buildup of ammonia and other toxic substances leads to the signs and symptoms of adult-onset type II citrullinemia. A lack of citrin also leads to the features of NICCD and FTTDCD, although ammonia does not build up in the bloodstream of individuals with these conditions.Because citrullinemia is caused by problems with the urea cycle, it belongs to a class of genetic diseases called urea cycle disorders.Learn more about the genes associated with CitrullinemiaASS1SLC25A13Inheritance PatternBoth types of citrullinemia are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the respective gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.'},\n",

       "   'title': 'Familial Mediterranean fever',\n",
       "   'text': \"Familial Mediterranean fever is an inherited condition characterized by recurrent episodes of painful inflammation in the abdomen, chest, or joints. These episodes are often accompanied by fever and sometimes a rash or headache. Occasionally inflammation may occur in other parts of the body, such as the heart; the membrane surrounding the brain and spinal cord; and in males, the testicles. In about half of affected individuals, attacks are preceded by mild signs and symptoms known as a prodrome. Prodromal symptoms include mildly uncomfortable sensations in the area that will later become inflamed, or more general feelings of discomfort.   The first episode of illness in familial Mediterranean fever usually occurs in childhood or the teenage years, but in some cases, the initial attack occurs much later in life. Typically, episodes last 12 to 72 hours and can vary in severity. The length of time between attacks is also variable and can range from days to years. During these periods, affected individuals usually have no signs or symptoms related to the condition. However, without treatment to help prevent attacks and complications, a buildup of protein deposits (amyloidosis) in the body's organs and tissues may occur, especially in the kidneys, which can lead to kidney failure.

The MEFV gene provides instructions for making a protein called pyrin (also known as marenostrin), which is found in white blood cells. This protein is involved in the immune system, helping to regulate the process of inflammation. Inflammation occurs when the immune system sends signaling molecules and white blood cells to a site of injury or disease to fight microbial invaders and facilitate tissue repair. When this process is complete, the body stops the inflammatory response to prevent damage to its own cells and tissues.Mutations in the MEFV gene reduce the activity of the pyrin protein, which disrupts control of the inflammation process. An inappropriate or prolonged inflammatory response can result, leading to fever and pain in the abdomen, chest, or joints.Normal variations in the SAA1 gene may modify the course of familial Mediterranean fever. Some evidence suggests that a particular version of the SAA1 gene (called the alpha variant) increases the risk of amyloidosis among people with familial Mediterranean fever.Learn more about the genes associated with Familial Mediterranean feverMEFVSAA1Inheritance PatternFamilial Mediterranean fever is almost always inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the MEFV gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.In rare cases, this condition appears to be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. An autosomal dominant inheritance pattern describes cases in which one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In autosomal dominant inheritance, affected individuals often inherit the mutation from one affected parent.However, another mechanism is believed to account for some cases of familial Mediterranean fever that were originally thought to be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. A gene mutation that occurs frequently in a population may result in a disorder with autosomal recessive inheritance appearing in multiple generations in a family, a pattern that mimics autosomal dominant inheritance. If one parent has familial Mediterranean fever (with mutations in both copies of the MEFV gene in each cell) and the other parent is an unaffected carrier (with a mutation in one copy of the MEFV gene in each cell), it may appear as if the affected child inherited the disorder only from the affected parent. This appearance of autosomal dominant inheritance when the pattern is actually autosomal recessive is called pseudodominance.\"},\n",

(2001) reported a 4-month-old boy who presented with a spontaneous massive bleed in the posterior chamber of the right eye along with cutaneous hemorrhages. Laboratory studies showed marked thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. The patient experienced multiple episodes of bleeding over the next 30 months, including severe pulmonary hemorrhage. He also had multiple recurrent bacterial infections. Bone marrow transplantation was performed at age 34 months, but the patient died of complications at age 37 months.Mohamed et al. (2013) reported a 22-year-old woman, born of consanguineous Turkish parents, with CDG2F. She apparently had normal early development until age 7 years, when she developed psychomotor delay and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Behavioral abnormalities manifested at puberty. At age 20, she presented with microcephaly, mild ataxia, hypotonia and hyporeflexia of the lower extremities, intellectual disability, and a systolic cardiac murmur due to aortic insufficiency. Dysmorphic features included flat occiput, hypotelorism, deep-set eyes, short philtrum, webbed neck, clinodactyly, bilateral hallux valgus, and joint hyperlaxity. Brain imaging showed no structural abnormalities. Laboratory studies showed macrothrombocytopenia, proteinuria, aminoaciduria, and transiently reduced levels of coagulation factors. She died at age 22 years from surgical complications, including renal failure due to tubular necrosis. Isoelectric focusing of patient serum transferrin showed hypoglycosylation in a pattern consistent with type II CDG. Further protein analysis showed reduced sialylation and a combined defect in N- and mucin-type O-glycosylation.Ng et al. (2017) reported a 12-year-old girl (patient CDG-374) of German ancestry with CDG2F manifest as severe encephalopathy. She presented with hypotonia and developed seizures with orofacial tics at age 4 months. The seizures were only partially controlled. EEG was normal at onset, but later showed slowing and generalized and focal spikes and polyspikes. She had severely delayed psychomotor development with intellectual disability (IQ less than 55), poor speech, and mild ataxic-dyskinetic movements. Additional features included nystagmus, autistic features, and dysarthria. She did not have coagulation defects. Laboratory studies showed a serum transferrin CDG type II pattern and a combined defect in N- and O-glycosylation.Biochemical FeaturesBy detailed laboratory analysis of a patient with thrombocytopenia and recurrent infections, Willig et al. (2001) found markedly decreased amounts of platelet membrane GP Ib (see GP1BA, 606672) and undetectable sialyl-Lewis-X on the surface of neutrophils, suggesting a defect in the posttranslational modification of glycoproteins. Martinez-Duncker et al. (2005) noted that the plasma of the patient reported by Willig et al. (2001) showed a normal sialylation pattern of transferrin (TF; 190000) and other major serum glycoproteins. The phenotype was due to the lack of sialyl-Lewis-X, which has considerable roles in cell-to-cell interactions, such as infections and megakaryocytic immaturity, that were defective in this patient.Riemersma et al. (2015) found that transfection of the SLC35A1 Q101H mutation (605634.0003) into SLC35A1-deficient cells partially restored sialylation, but failed to restore deficient O-mannosylation, particularly on alpha-dystroglycan (DAG; 128239). In addition, laminin binding to DAG could not be restored, suggesting that abnormal glycosylation of DAG is another biochemical defect in patients with CDG2F. These findings indicated that the disorder represents a combined CDG and muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy (see, e.g., MDDGA1, 236670). The patient who carried this mutation (Mohamed et al., 2013) showed reduced sialylation and a combined defect in N- and mucin-type O-glycosylation.InheritanceThe transmission pattern of CDG2F in the family reported by Mohamed et al. (2013) was consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance.Molecular GeneticsIn a patient originally described by Willig et al. (2001), Martinez-Duncker et al. (2005) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the SLC35A1 gene (605634.0001; 605634.0002). Martinez-Duncker et al. (2005) referred to this disorder as CDG type IIf.In a 22-year-old woman, born of consanguineous Turkish parents, with CDG2F, Mohamed et al. (2013) identified a homozygous missense mutation in the SLC35A1 gene (Q101H; 605634.0003). The mutation, which was found by homozygosity mapping and candidate gene sequencing, was found in heterozygous state in her unaffected parents. In vitro functional expression studies in yeast showed that the Q101H variant resulted in 50% decreased CMP-Sia transport activity compared to controls. SLC35A1-deficient mammalian cells transfected with the Q101H mutation showed significantly reduced (about 15%) restoration of polysialic acid expression compared to wildtype.In a 12-year-old German girl (patient CDG-374) with CDG2F, Ng et al. (2017) identified compound heterozygous missense mutations in the SLC35A1 gene (T156R, 605634.0004 and E196K, 605634.0005). The mutations, which were found by exome sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing, segregated with the disorder in the family. Analysis of patient cells showed decreased amounts of N- and O-glycans terminating in sialic acid as well as a severe loss of SLC35A1 transport function.INHERITANCE- Autosomal recessiveHEAD & NECKHead- Microcephaly- Flat occiput (patient B)Face- Short philtrum (patient B)Eyes- Hypotelorism (patient B)- Deep-set eyes (patient B)- Nystagmus (patient C)Neck- Webbed neck (patient B)CARDIOVASCULARHeart- Aortic insufficiency (patient B)GENITOURINARYKidneys- Renal tubulopathy (patient B)SKELETAL- Joint hyperlaxityHands- ClinodactylyMUSCLE, SOFT TISSUES- HypotoniaNEUROLOGICCentral Nervous System- Delayed psychomotor development- Encephalopathy- Intellectual disability- Seizures- Ataxia- Dysarthria- Orofacial dyskinesia- Poor speechPeripheral Nervous System- HyporeflexiaBehavioral Psychiatric Manifestations- Autistic featuresHEMATOLOGY- Thrombocytopenia (patient A)- Macrothrombocytopenia (patient B)- Neutropenia (patient A)- Recurrent hemorrhagic events (patients A and B)- Abnormal platelets with giant morphology (patient A)- Megakaryocytes show ultrastructural defects with abnormal membranes (patient A)- Neutrophil membranes show absence of sialyl-Lewis-X (patient A)- Platelets show decreased GPIb (patient A)- Transiently reduced levels of coagulation factors (patient B)IMMUNOLOGY- Recurrent bacterial infections (patient A)LABORATORY ABNORMALITIES- Isoelectric focusing of patient serum transferrin shows Hypoglycosylation serum transferrin shows a pattern consistent with type II CDG- Reduced sialylation- Combined defect in N- and mucin-type O-glycosylation- Proteinuria (patient B)- Aminoaciduria (patient B)MISCELLANEOUS- Onset in infancy or childhood- Highly variable phenotype- Patient A died at age 3 years- Patient C had onset at age 7 years- Three unrelated patients have been reported (last curated January 2018)MOLECULAR BASIS- Caused by mutation in the solute carrier family 35, CMP-sialic acid transporter, member 1 gene (SLC35A1,605634.0001)▲Close'},\n",

       "   'text': 'Rare genetic disorder of the white matter of the brainAlexander diseaseBrain of a 4-year-old boy with Alexander disease showing macroencephaly and periventricular leukomalacia (note brownish discoloration around the cerebral ventricles)SpecialtyEndocrinology, neurologyAlexander disease is a very rare autosomal dominant leukodystrophy, which are neurological conditions caused by anomalies in the myelin which protects nerve fibers in the brain. The most common type is the infantile form that usually begins during the first 2 years of life. Symptoms include mental and physical developmental delays, followed by the loss of developmental milestones, an abnormal increase in head size and seizures. The juvenile form of Alexander disease has an onset between the ages of 2 and 13 years. These children may have excessive vomiting, difficulty swallowing and speaking, poor coordination, and loss of motor control. Adult-onset forms of Alexander disease are less common. The symptoms sometimes mimic those of Parkinson’s disease or multiple sclerosis, or may present primarily as a psychiatric disorder.According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the destruction of white matter is accompanied by the formation of Rosenthal fibers—abnormal clumps of protein that accumulate in astrocytes in the brain.The disease occurs in both males and females, and no ethnic, racial, geographic or cultural/economic differences are seen in its distribution. Alexander disease is a progressive and often fatal disease.[1]Contents1 Presentation2 Cause3 Pathology4 Diagnosis5 Treatment6 Prognosis7 Prevalence8 See also9 References10 External linksPresentation[edit]Delays in development of some physical, psychological and behavioral skills; progressive enlargement of the head (macrocephaly), seizures, spasticity, and in some cases also hydrocephalus, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and dementia.[2]Cause[edit]Alexander disease is a genetic disorder affecting the midbrain and cerebellum of the central nervous system. It is caused by mutations in the gene for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)[3][4][5] that maps to chromosome 17q21. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, such that the child of a parent with the disease has a 50% chance of inheriting the condition, if the parent is heterozygotic. However, most cases arise de novo as the result of sporadic mutations.[2]Alexander disease belongs to leukodystrophies, a group of diseases that affect the growth or development of the myelin sheath. The destruction of white matter in the brain is accompanied by the formation of fibrous, eosinophilic deposits known as Rosenthal fibers.[2][6][7] Rosenthal fibers appear not to be present in healthy people,[6][8] but occur in specific diseases, like some forms of cancer, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, Huntington’s, and ALS.[6][8][9] The Rosenthal fibers found in Alexander disease do not share the distribution or concentration of other diseases and disorders.[6]Pathology[edit]Alexander disease causes the gradual loss of bodily functions and the ability to talk. It also causes an overload of long-chain fatty acids in the brain, which destroy the myelin sheath. The cause of Alexander disease is a mutation in the gene encoding GFAP.[2][6][3][4][10][9][excessive citations]A CT scan shows:Decreased density of white matterFrontal lobe predominanceDilated lateral ventricles may presentDiagnosis[edit]Detecting the signs of Alexander disease is possible with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which looks for specific changes in the brain that may be tell-tale signs for the disease.[11][12] It is even possible to detect adult-onset Alexander disease with MRI.[10] Alexander disease may also be revealed by genetic testing for its known cause.[13][14] A rough diagnosis may also be made through revealing of clinical symptoms, including enlarged head size, along with radiological studies, and negative tests for other leukodystrophies.[8]Treatment[edit]No cure or standard procedure for treatment is known, although a University of Wisconsin study shows promise with gene editing of the astrocytes.[2][6][9] A bone marrow transplant has been attempted on a child, but it made no improvement.[15][16] Hydrocephalus may be seen in younger patients and can be relieved with surgery or by implanting a shunt to relieve pressure.[17]Prognosis[edit]The prognosis is generally poor. With early onset, death usually occurs within 10 years from the onset of symptoms. Individuals with the infantile form usually die before the age of seven.[18] Usually, the later the disease occurs, the slower its course.[2][6]Prevalence[edit]Its occurrence is very rare. The infantile form occurs from birth to 2 years of age.[5] The average duration of the infantile form is usually about 3 years. Onset of the juvenile form presents between 2 and 12 years of age.[5] Duration of this form is in most cases about 6 years. The adult form occurs after 12 years.[5] In younger patients, seizures, megalencephaly, developmental delay, and spasticity are usually present. Neonatal onset is also reported.[19] Onset in adults is least frequent. In older patients, bulbar or pseudobulbar symptoms and spasticity predominate. Symptoms of the adult form may also resemble multiple sclerosis.[2] No more than 500 cases have been reported.[2]See also[edit]The Myelin ProjectThe Stennis FoundationReferences[edit]^ .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}\"Alexander Disease Information Page\".

       "   'text': \"Benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis (BRIC) is characterized by episodes of liver dysfunction called cholestasis. During these episodes, the liver cells have a reduced ability to release a digestive fluid called bile. Because the problems with bile release occur within the liver (intrahepatic), the condition is described as intrahepatic cholestasis. Episodes of cholestasis can last from weeks to months, and the time between episodes, during which there are usually no symptoms, can vary from weeks to years.The first episode of cholestasis usually occurs in an affected person's teens or twenties. An attack typically begins with severe itchiness (pruritus), followed by yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice) a few weeks later. Other general signs and symptoms that occur during these episodes include a vague feeling of discomfort (malaise), irritability, nausea, vomiting, and a lack of appetite. A common feature of BRIC is the reduced absorption of fat in the body, which leads to excess fat in the feces (steatorrhea). Because of a lack of fat absorption and loss of appetite, affected individuals often lose weight during episodes of cholestasis.BRIC is divided into two types, BRIC1 and BRIC2, based on the genetic cause of the condition. The signs and symptoms are the same in both types.This condition is called benign because it does not cause lasting damage to the liver. However, episodes of liver dysfunction occasionally develop into a more severe, permanent form of liver disease known as progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC). BRIC and PFIC are sometimes considered to be part of a spectrum of intrahepatic cholestasis disorders of varying severity.FrequencyBRIC is a rare disorder. Although the prevalence is unknown, this condition is less common than the related disorder PFIC, which affects approximately 1 in 50,000 to 100,000 people worldwide.CausesMutations in the ATP8B1 gene cause benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis type 1 (BRIC1), and mutations in the ABCB11 gene cause benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis type 2 (BRIC2). These two genes are involved in the release (secretion) of bile, a fluid produced by the liver that helps digest fats.The ATP8B1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps to control the distribution of certain fats, called lipids, in the membranes of liver cells. This function likely plays a role in maintaining an appropriate balance of bile acids, a component of bile. This process, known as bile acid homeostasis, is critical for the normal secretion of bile and the proper functioning of liver cells. Although the mechanism is unclear, mutations in the ATP8B1 gene result in the buildup of bile acids in liver cells. The imbalance of bile acids leads to the signs and symptoms of BRIC1.The ABCB11 gene provides instructions for making a protein called the bile salt export pump (BSEP). This protein is found in the liver, and its main role is to move bile salts (a component of bile) out of liver cells. Mutations in the ABCB11 gene result in a reduction of BSEP function. This reduction leads to a decrease of bile salt secretion, which causes the features of BRIC2.The factors that trigger episodes of BRIC are unknown.Some people with BRIC do not have a mutation in the ATP8B1 or ABCB11 gene. In these individuals, the cause of the condition is unknown.Learn more about the genes associated with Benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasisABCB11ATP8B1Inheritance PatternBoth types of BRIC are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.Some people with BRIC have no family history of the disorder. These cases arise from mutations in the ATP8B1 or ABCB11 gene that occur in the body's cells after conception and are not inherited.\"},\n",

(2016) reported an 18-year-old girl with a neurodevelopmental disorder who met diagnostic criteria for Rett syndrome (RTT; 312750). She showed developmental regression around 6 months of age, and developed complex partial seizures around 8 months. Additional features included swallowing problems, dystonia, bradykinesia, and continuous manual stereotypies without chorea. She had severe intellectual disability with poor speech, bruxism, kyphosis/scoliosis, small and cold hands and feet, diminished response to pain, and respiratory, sleep, and gait dysfunction. Brain imaging showed atrophy of the striatum, particularly the caudate nuclei, as well as mild atrophy of the cortex and cerebellar vermis.Rodan et al. (2016) reported a consanguineous family from Ecuador in which 3 sibs had a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by severe global developmental delay since birth, central hypotonia progressing to spastic quadriparesis, intellectual disability with poor or absent speech, and feeding difficulties. More variable features included dystonia, midline stereotypies, and high myopia. One patient had seizures and 1 patient had bruxism. One of the patients died unexpectedly at age 7 years. Two of the sibs had features reminiscent of Rett syndrome.InheritanceThe transmission pattern of LOMARS in the family reported by Rodan et al. (2016) was consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance.Molecular GeneticsIn a girl with LOMARS, Lopes et al. (2016) identified compound heterozygous missense mutations in the HTT gene (P703L, 613004.0002 and T1260M, 613004.0003). The mutations, which were found by exome sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing, segregated with the disorder in the family. Functional studies of the variants and studies of patient cells were not performed, but Lopes et al. (2016) noted that the HTT gene interacts with MECP2 (300005), which is mutant in Rett syndrome. Mutations in MECP2 were excluded in the patient.In 3 sibs, born of parents of Ecuadorian descent, with LOMARS, Rodan et al. (2016) identified compound heterozygous mutations in the HTT gene (613004.0004 and 613004.0005). The mutations, which were found by exome sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing, segregated with the disorder in the family.

One of the 3 sibs, a 2-year-old girl, died of respiratory insufficiency resulting from a lymphocytic thymoma. Her 9-month-old brother died 2 years earlier of the same cause. The eldest sib, a male, and the parents were healthy. No reference was made concerning parental consanguinity. Thymomas are notably rare in persons of this young age.Wick et al. (1982) described 2 brothers who developed malignant epithelial tumors of the thymus. One had thymic carcinoma with death in his late 50s; the other had an invasive spindle cell thymoma with associated hypogammaglobulinemia. The authors thought the occurrence particularly significant because thymic tumors are rare and malignant forms especially so.Nicodeme et al. (2005) studied a family bearing the constitutional chromosome translocation t(14;20)(q24;p12). Eleven of 27 family members had the translocation breakpoint; of these 11, 3 had thymoma and 4 others had 5 different autoimmune diseases (109100), namely, diabetes mellitus type I, Graves disease, pernicious anemia, Sjogren disease, and autoimmune pancytopenia. FISH studies demonstrated that the 14q24 breakpoint was in intron 5 of the RAD51L1 gene (602948), and the 20p breakpoint was 100 kb telomeric to the BMP2 gene (112261). RAD51L1 is a tumor-suppressing gene implicated in many tumors (e.g., uterine leiomyomas and pulmonary chondroid hamartomas) and involved in recombinational repair of DNA double-strand breaks. BMP2 belongs to the TGF-beta superfamily and is involved in the maturation of T lymphocytes in the thymic stroma. Dysregulation of RAD51L1 and/or BMP2 was thought to explain the familial occurrence of thymomas and autoimmune diseases.Population GeneticsNicodeme et al. (2005) stated that familial thymoma has a prevalence of 0.1 to 0.4 per 100,000.Molecular GeneticsSomatic MutationPetrini et al. (2014) analyzed 28 thymic epithelial tumors using next-generation sequencing and identified a missense mutation (chromosome 7 c.74146970 T-A) in the GTF2I gene (601679) at high frequency in type A thymomas, a relatively indolent subtype. In a series of 274 thymic epithelial tumors, Petrini et al. (2014) detected the GTF2I mutation in 82% of type A and 74% of type AB thymomas but rarely in the aggressive subtypes, where recurrent mutations of known cancer genes have been identified. Therefore, GTF2I mutation correlated with better survival. GTF2I beta and delta isoforms were expressed in thymic epithelial tumors, and both mutant isoforms were able to stimulate cell proliferation in vitro. Thymic carcinomas carried a higher number of mutations than thymomas (average of 43.5 and 18.4, respectively).INHERITANCE- Somatic mutationRESPIRATORY- Respiratory insufficiencyIMMUNOLOGY- ThymomaNEOPLASIA- Thymoma▲Close'},\n",

       "   'text': \"A number sign (#) is used with this entry because of evidence that familial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia-5 (HHF5) is caused by heterozygous mutation in the insulin receptor gene (INSR; 147670) on chromosome 19p13.For a phenotypic description and a discussion of genetic heterogeneity of familial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, see HHF1 (256450).Clinical FeaturesHojlund et al. (2004) described a large 3-generation Danish family in which affected members had postprandial episodes of neuroglycopenia. The proband was a 21-year-old woman who since the age of 12 had experienced episodes of blurred vision, loss of consciousness, and seizures, occurring 2 to 5 hours after eating, often in conjunction with exercise and relieved by food ingestion. Her EEG was normal. At age 20, hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia was documented; the patient was noted to be nonobese with no signs of insulin resistance such as skin pigmentation or hirsutism. Nine other family members in 3 generations also had episodes of hypoglycemia which ranged from moderate symptoms of hypoglycemia in 2 family members to episodes with loss of consciousness in 8 and seizures causing admission to emergency units in 5. The reported age of onset was between 3 and 30 years, and all affected family members were shown to have fasting hyperinsulinemia and an elevated serum insulin-to-C-peptide ratio. The proband's sister, who had moderate symptoms of hypoglycemia, showed mild skin pigmentation in the axillae, increased total and free serum levels of testosterone, and polycystic ovaries.MappingBy linkage analysis using DNA from 19 members of a 3-generation Danish family with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, Hojlund et al. (2004) found complete cosegregation of the disease phenotype with a specific haplotype in the insulin receptor region on 19p13. A maximum lod score of 3.21 was achieved.Molecular GeneticsIn all affected members of a 3-generation Danish family with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, Hojlund et al.

Preliminary sensations of pain in the general area of attack, referred to as \"shadows\", may signal an imminent CH, or these symptoms may linger after an attack has passed, or between attacks.[11] Though CH is strictly unilateral, there are some documented cases of \"side-shift\" between cluster periods,[12] or, rarely, simultaneous (within the same cluster period) bilateral cluster headaches.[13]Pain[edit]The pain occurs only on one side of the head, around the eye, particularly above the eye, in the temple. The pain is typically greater than in other headache conditions, including migraines.The pain is typically described as burning, stabbing, drilling or squeezing, and may be located near or behind the eye.[14] As a result of the pain, those with cluster headaches may experience suicidal thoughts during an attack (giving the alternative name \"suicide headache\" or \"suicidal headache\").[15][16] It is reported as one of the most painful conditions.[17]Other symptoms[edit]The typical symptoms of cluster headache include grouped occurrence and recurrence (cluster) of headache attack, severe unilateral orbital, supraorbital and/or temporal pain. If left untreated, attack frequency may range from one attack every two days to eight attacks per day.[2][18] Cluster headache attack is accompanied by at least one of the following autonomic symptoms: drooping eyelid, pupil constriction, redness of the conjunctiva, tearing, runny nose and less commonly, facial blushing, swelling, or sweating, typically appearing on the same side of the head as the pain.[18]Restlessness (for example, pacing or rocking back and forth) may occur. Similar to a migraine, sensitivity to light (photophobia) or noise (phonophobia) may occur during a CH. Nausea is a rare symptom although it has been reported.[7] Secondary effects may include the inability to organize thoughts and plans, physical exhaustion, confusion, agitation, aggressiveness, depression, and anxiety.[15]People with CH may dread facing another headache and adjust their physical or social activities around a possible future occurrence. Likewise they may seek assistance to accomplish what would otherwise be normal tasks. They may hesitate to make plans because of the regularity, or conversely, the unpredictability of the pain schedule. These factors can lead to generalized anxiety disorders, panic disorder,[15] serious depressive disorders,[19] social withdrawal and isolation.[20]Recurrence[edit]Cluster headaches may occasionally be referred to as \"alarm clock headache\" because of the regularity of their recurrence. CH attacks often awaken individuals from sleep.Both individual attacks and the cluster grouping can have a metronomic regularity; attacks typically striking at a precise time of day each morning or night. The recurrence of headache cluster grouping may occur more often around solstices, or seasonal changes, sometimes showing circannual periodicity. Conversely, attack frequency may be highly unpredictable, showing no periodicity at all. These observations have prompted researchers to speculate an involvement or dysfunction of the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus controls the body\\'s \"biological clock\" and circadian rhythm.[21][22] In episodic cluster headache, attacks occur once or more daily, often at the same time each day for a period of several weeks, followed by a headache-free period lasting weeks, months, or years. Approximately 10–15% of cluster headaches are chronic, with multiple headaches occurring every day for years, sometimes without any remission.[23]In accordance with the International Headache Society (IHS) diagnostic criteria, cluster headaches occurring in two or more cluster periods, lasting from 7 to 365 days with a pain-free remission of one month or longer between the headache attacks, may be classified as episodic. If headache attacks occur for more than a year without pain-free remission of at least one month, the condition is classified as chronic.[18]Chronic CH both occurs and recurs without any remission periods between cycles; there may be variation in cycles, meaning the frequency and severity of attacks may change without predictability for a period of time. The frequency, severity, and duration of headache attacks experienced by people during these cycles varies between individuals and does not demonstrate complete remission of the episodic form. The condition may change unpredictably from chronic to episodic and from episodic to chronic.[24]Causes[edit]Positron emission tomography (PET) shows brain areas being activated during painVoxel-based morphometry (VBM) shows brain area structural differencesThe cause of cluster headache is unknown.[25] Cluster headaches were historically described as vascular headaches, with the belief that intense pain was caused by dilation of blood vessels which in turn, was thought to create pressure on the trigeminal nerve. The vascular theory has been called into question [26] and other mechanisms are being considered.[27] The Third Edition of the Internal Classification of Headache disorders classifies CH as belonging to the trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias.[28]Nerves[edit]Two nerves are thought to play an important role in CH: the trigeminal nerve and the facial nerve.[29]Genetics[edit]Cluster headache may run in some families in an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern.[30][25] People with a first degree relative with the condition are about 14–48 times more likely to develop it themselves,[1] and around 8 to 10% of persons with CH have a positive family history.[30][31] Several studies have found a higher number of relatives affected among female.[31] Others have suggested these observations may be due to lower numbers of females in these studies.[31] Possible genetic factors warrant further research, current evidence for genetic inheritance is limited.[25]Genes that are thought to play a role in the disease are the hypocretin/orexin receptor type 2 (HCRTR2), alcohol dehydrogenase 4(ADH4), G protein beta 3 (GNB3), pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide type I receptor (ADCYAP1R1), and membrane metalloendopeptidase (MME) genes.[30]Tobacco smoking[edit]About 65% of persons with CH are, or have been, tobacco smokers.[1] Stopping smoking does not lead to improvement of the condition and CH also occurs in those who have never smoked (e.g. children);[1] it is thought unlikely that smoking is a cause.[1] People with CH may be predisposed to certain traits, including smoking or other lifestyle habits.[32]Hypothalamus[edit]A review suggests that the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus, which is the major biological clock in the human body, may be involved in cluster headaches, because CH occurs with diurnal and seasonal rhythmicity.[33]Positron emission tomography (PET) scans indicate the brain areas which are activated during attack only, compared to pain free periods. These pictures show brain areas that are active during pain in yellow/orange color (called \"pain matrix\"). The area in the center (in all three views) is specifically activated during CH only. The bottom row voxel-based morphometry (VBM) shows structural brain differences between individuals with and without CH; only a portion of the hypothalamus is different.[34]Diagnosis[edit]Cluster-like head pain may be diagnosed as secondary headache rather than cluster headache.[18]A detailed oral history aids practitioners in correct differential diagnosis, as there are no confirmatory tests for CH.A headache diary can be useful in tracking when and where pain occurs, how severe it is, and how long the pain lasts. A record of coping strategies used may help distinguish between headache type; data on frequency, severity and duration of headache attacks are a necessary tool for initial and correct differential diagnosis in headache conditions.[35]Correct diagnosis presents a challenge as the first CH attack may present where staff are not trained in the diagnosis of rare or complex chronic disease.[9] Although experienced ER staff are sometimes trained to detect headache types,[36] CH attacks themselves are not directly life-threatening, they are linked to an increased risk of suicide.[15][37]Individuals with CH typically experience diagnostic delay before correct diagnosis.[38] People are often misdiagnosed due to reported neck, tooth, jaw, and sinus symptoms and may unnecessarily endure many years of referral to ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialists for investigation of sinuses; dentists for tooth assessment; chiropractors and manipulative therapists for treatment; or psychiatrists, psychologists, and other medical disciplines before their headaches are correctly diagnosed.[39] Under-recognition of CH by health care professionals is reflected in consistent findings in Europe and the United States that the average time to diagnosis is around seven years.[40]Differential[edit]Cluster headache may be misdiagnosed as migraine or sinusitis.[40]Other types of headache are sometimes mistaken for, or may mimic closely, CH. Incorrect terms like \"cluster migraine\" confuse headache types, confound differential diagnosis and are often the cause of unnecessary diagnostic delay,[41] ultimately delaying appropriate specialist treatment.Headaches that may be confused with CH include:Chronic paroxysmal hemicrania (CPH) is a unilateral headache condition, without the male predominance usually seen in CH. Paroxysmal hemicrania may also be episodic but the episodes of pain seen in CPH are usually shorter than those seen with cluster headaches. CPH typically responds \"absolutely\" to treatment with the anti-inflammatory drug indomethacin[18] where in most cases CH typically shows no positive indomethacin response, making \"Indomethacin response\" an important diagnostic tool for specialist practitioners seeking correct differential diagnosis between the conditions.[42][43]Hemicrania continua[44]Short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache with conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT) is a headache syndrome belonging to the group of TACs.[18][45]Trigeminal neuralgia is a unilateral headache syndrome,[39] or \"cluster-like\" headache.[46]Prevention[edit]Preventive treatments are used to reduce or eliminate cluster headache attacks; they are generally used in combination with abortive and transitional techniques.[7]Verapamil[edit]The recommended first-line preventive therapy is verapamil, a calcium channel blocker.[2][47] Verapamil was previously underused in people with cluster headache.[7]Improvement can be seen in an average of 1.7 weeks for episodic CH and 5 weeks for chronic CH when using a dosage of ranged between 160 and 720mg (mean 240mg/day).[48] Preventive therapy with verapamil is believed to work because it has an effect on the circadian rhythm and on CGRPs. As CGRP-release is controlled by voltage-gated calcium channels.[48]Glucocorticoids[edit]There is little evidence to support a long-term benefit from glucocorticoids,[2] but they may be used until other medications take effect as they appear to be effective at three days.[2] They are generally discontinued after 8–10 days of treatment.[7]Surgery[edit]Nerve stimulators may be an option in the small number of people who do not improve with medications.[49][50] Two procedures, deep brain stimulation or occipital nerve stimulation, may be useful;[2] early experience shows a benefit in about 60% of cases.[51] It typically takes weeks or months for this benefit to appear.[50] A non-invasive method using transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is being studied.[50]A number of surgical procedures, such as a rhizotomy or microvascular decompression, may also be considered,[50] but evidence to support them is limited and there are cases of people whose symptoms worsen after these procedures.[50]Other[edit]Lithium, methysergide,and topiramate are recommended alternative treatments,[47][52] although there is little evidence supporting the use of topiramate or methysergide.[2][53] This is also true for tianeptine, melatonin, and ergotamine.[2] Valproate, sumatriptan, and oxygen are not recommended as preventive measures.[2] Botulinum toxin injections have shown limited success.[54] Evidence for baclofen, botulinum toxin, and capsaicin is unclear.[53]Management[edit]Treatment for cluster headache is divided into three primary categories: abortive, transitional, and preventive.[55] There are two primary treatments for acute CH: oxygen and triptans,[2] but they are underused due to misdiagnosis of the syndrome.[7] During bouts of headaches, triggers such as alcohol, nitroglycerine and naps during the day should be avoided.[9]Oxygen[edit]Oxygen therapy may help to abort attacks, though it does not prevent future episodes.[2] Typically it is given via a non-rebreather mask at 12–15 liters per minute for 15–20 minutes.[2] One review found about 70% of patients improve within 15 minutes.[9] The evidence for effectiveness of 100% oxygen, however, is weak.[9][56] Hyperbaric oxygen at pressures of ~2 times greater than atmospheric pressure may relieve cluster headaches.[56]Triptans[edit]The other primarily recommended treatment of acute attacks is subcutaneous or intranasal sumatriptan.[47] Sumatriptan and zolmitriptan have both been shown to improve symptoms during an attack with sumatriptan being superior.[57] Because of the vasoconstrictive side-effect of triptans, they may be contraindicated in people with ischemic heart disease.[2]Opioids[edit]The use of opioid medication in management of CH is not recommended[58] and may make headache syndromes worse.[59][60] Long-term opioid use is associated with well known dependency, addiction, and withdrawal syndromes.[61] Prescription of opioid medication may additionally lead to further delay in differential diagnosis, undertreatment, and mismanagement.[58]Other[edit]The vasoconstrictor ergot compounds may be useful,[9] but have not been well studied in acute attacks.[57] Octreotide administered subcutaneously has been demonstrated to be more effective than placebo for the treatment of acute attacks.[62]Intranasal lidocaine (sprayed in the ipsilateral nostril) may be an effective treatment with patient resistant to more conventionnal treatment.[10]Epidemiology[edit]Cluster headache affects about 0.1% of the general population at some point in their life.[5] Males are affected about four times more often than females.[5] The condition usually starts between the ages of 20 and 50 years, although it can occur at any age.[1] About one in five of adults reports the onset of cluster headache between 10 and 19 years.[63]History[edit]The first complete description of cluster headache was given by the London neurologist Wilfred Harris in 1926, who named the disease migrainous neuralgia.[64][65][66]Descriptions of CH date to 1745 and probably earlier.[67]The condition was originally named Horton\\'s cephalalgia after Bayard Taylor Horton, a US neurologist who postulated the first theory as to their pathogenesis. His original paper describes the severity of the headaches as being able to take normal men and force them to attempt or complete suicide; his 1939 paper said:\"Our patients were disabled by the disorder and suffered from bouts of pain from two to twenty times a week. They had found no relief from the usual methods of treatment. Their pain was so severe that several of them had to be constantly watched for fear of suicide. Most of them were willing to submit to any operation which might bring relief.\"[68]CH has alternately been called erythroprosopalgia of Bing, ciliary neuralgia, erythromelalgia of the head, Horton\\'s headache, histaminic cephalalgia, petrosal neuralgia, sphenopalatine neuralgia, vidian neuralgia, Sluder\\'s neuralgia, Sluder\\'s syndrome, and hemicrania angioparalyticia.[69]Society and culture[edit]Robert Shapiro, a professor of neurology, says that while cluster headaches are about as common as multiple sclerosis with a similar disability level, as of 2013, the US National Institutes of Health had spent $1.872 billion on research into multiple sclerosis in one decade, but less than $2 million on CH research in 25 years.[70]As of July 2015[update] there are no approved medicines for the prevention of cluster headache in the United States.[71]Research directions[edit]Some case reports suggest that ingesting tryptamines such as LSD, psilocybin (as found in hallucinogenic mushrooms), or DMT can reduce pain and interrupt cluster headache cycles.[72][73] A 2006 survey of 53 individuals found people said that psilocybin extended remission periods in 18 of 19. The survey was not a blinded or a controlled study, and was \"limited by recall and selection bias\".[72] The safety and efficacy of psilocybin is currently being studied in cluster headache.[74][75]Fremanezumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against calcitonin gene-related peptides alpha and beta, is in phase 3 clinical trials for CH.[76][77]References[edit]^ a b c d e f g h i .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}Nesbitt, A.

       "   'text': 'Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis is a genetic disease that causes episodes of extreme muscle weakness and an increase of the potassium levels in the blood. Muscle weakness during an attack usually affects the arms and legs and muscles of the eyes, throat, and trunk. Most often, these episodes involve a temporary inability to move muscles in the arms and legs. Episodes usually begin before age 20, usually between infancy and age 10. Normally an episode lasts for 15 minutes to an hour, but in some people the episodes may last a few days to a week. Episodes tend to increase in frequency until about age 50, after which they may occur less frequently. Factors that can trigger attacks include rest after strenuous exercise, potassium-rich foods, stress, fatigue, and exposure to cold. Depolarizing anesthetics should also be avoided. Muscle strength usually returns to normal between episodes, although manypeople continue to experience mild stiffness, particularly in muscles of the face and hands. Studies suggest more than 80% of people with hyperkalemic periodic paralysis over age 40 have permanent muscle weakness, most often affecting the leg muscles. About one third may develop a chronic progressive myopathy.  Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis is caused by mutations in the SCN4A gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominantmanner. Diagnosis is based on clinical symptoms including the increase of blood potassium level during an episode, but normal levels of blood potassium level in between episodes. Genetic testing can confirm the diagnosis. Treatment is focused on avoiding triggers and decreasing the severity of an episode. At the first sign of muscle weakness, episodes in many people may be prevented or stopped by mild exercise and/or eating carbohydrates, inhalation of salbutamol, or intravenous calcium gluconate.'},\n",

Additional symptoms may include muscle weakness, slurred speech, headaches, and seizures. Children with Sydenham's chorea often have emotional or behavioral problems such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, distractibility, irritability, and inappropriate outbursts of laughing or crying. Sydenham's chorea mostly affects children and adolescents and usually follows aStreptococcal infectionby anywhere form 1-8 months. Sydenham's chorea is one of the major clinical signs of acute rheumatic fever. The uncontrolled movements are often worse during periods of stress, fatigue, or excitement. In some cases, only one side of the body is affected. Sydenham's chorea usually resolves within 3 weeks to 3 months. However, symptoms may last longer in some cases.\"},\n",

       "   'text': \"A number sign (#) is used with this entry because atransferrinemia is caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutation in the structural gene for transferrin (TF; 190000) on chromosome 3q22. Variation in the TF gene also affects serum transferrin levels.Variation in the HFE gene (613609.0001) also affects serum transferrin levels (see TFQTL2, 614193).DescriptionAtransferrinemia is characterized by microcytic anemia and by iron loading. It can be treated effectively by plasma infusions (summary by Beutler et al., 2000).Clinical FeaturesHeilmeyer et al. (1961) described total absence of transferrin in a 7-year-old girl whose presenting complaint was severe hypochromic anemia. Death occurred from heart failure. Severe hemosiderosis of the heart and liver was found at autopsy. About half-normal levels of transferrin in both parents supported recessive inheritance (Goya et al., 1972).Goya et al. (1972) described a patient with only a trace of transferrin in the blood by immunologic methods, who responded well to parenteral administration of transferrin. Hayashi et al. (1993) restudied the family reported by Goya et al. (1972). The proband showed late onset of anemia and growth retardation (at age 7 years) and was found to have a healthy brother and a sister with very low transferrin levels. Supplementary therapy with apo-TF over a period of 5 years resulted in gradual disappearance of the anemia and improvement in growth. Severe deficiency of both TF and haptoglobin were demonstrated by immunoelectrophoretic studies. Recovery from anemia and the resumption of growth were dependent, however, only on his TF level. Hayashi et al. (1993) suggested that TF values less than 10 mg/dl may result in severe growth retardation and anemia, whereas persons with more than 20 mg/dl are apparently healthy. They also suggested that coexisting haptoglobin deficiency may alleviate hemosiderosis. Study by isoelectric focusing disclosed that there was a small amount of TF variant present in all 3 sibs, and that the variant was produced by an allelic gene derived from their father. For that reason, Hayashi et al. (1993) suggested that the condition be termed hypotransferrinemia, that it is a recessive trait, and that subjects with the recessive phenotype may be compound heterozygotes of a 'variant' allele and a 'null' allele.Westerhausen and Meuret (1977) observed an acquired (autoimmune) form of atransferrinemia.MappingSerum Transferrin Quantitative Trait LocusBenyamin et al. (2009) provided evidence that variation in the TF gene was associated with serum transferrin levels. A genomewide association study of 411 adolescent twins and their sibs, all of European descent, demonstrated that rs1830084, located 3-prime to the TF gene, was significantly associated with serum transferrin levels (p = 1.0 x 10(-9)). A second scan on an independent sample of 459 female monozygotic twin pairs found an association with rs3811647 within intron 11 of the TF gene (p = 3 x 10(-15)). The second scan also identified 2 additional and independent SNPs in TF (rs1799852 and rs2280673) that were associated with serum transferrin levels. The known C282Y variant in the HFE gene (613609.0001) was independently associated with serum transferrin (p = 1.1 x 10(-10)). The 3 TF SNPs found in the second scan plus the HFE C282Y mutation explained about 40% of genetic variation in serum transferrin levels (p = 7.8 x 10(-25)).Molecular GeneticsBeutler et al. (2000) stated that atransferrinemia had been reported in only 8 patients in 6 families. They reported the first known case in the United States and identified compound heterozygous mutations in the TF gene (190000.0006-190000.0007).Animal ModelCraven et al. (1987) studied hypotransferrinemia in the mouse. The tissue distribution of iron overload was similar to that in hemochromatosis; the hypotransferrinemic mice accumulated iron in the liver and pancreas. The authors suggested that hereditary hemochromatosis (235200) and congenital atransferrinemia in man are one and the same disease and that they are associated with subnormal concentration of plasma apo-transferrin. Inasmuch as the transferrin locus maps to chromosome 3 and the hemochromatosis locus to chromosome 6, the suggestion that the atransferrinemic mouse is a model of hemochromatosis cannot be extended to the level of the gene.Cardiovascular- Congestive heart failure-Hemosiderosis, heartInheritance- Autosomal recessiveLiver- HemosiderosisLab- Transferrin absentHeme- Anemia, hypochromic▲Close\"},\n",

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.Find sources:\"Diarrhetic shellfish poisoning\"–news· newspapers· books· scholar· JSTOR(May 2011) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)Diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) is one of the four recognized symptom types of shellfish poisoning, the others being paralytic shellfish poisoning, neurotoxic shellfish poisoning and amnesic shellfish poisoning.As the name suggests, this syndrome manifests itself as intense diarrhea and severe abdominal pains. Nausea and vomiting may sometimes occur too.DSP and its symptoms usually set in within about half an hour of ingesting infected shellfish, and last for about one day. A recent[when?] case in France, though, with 20 people consuming oysters manifested itself after 36 hours. The causative poison is okadaic acid, which inhibits intestinal cellular de-phosphorylation.[1] This causes the cells to become very permeable to water and causes profuse, intense diarrhea with a high risk of dehydration. As no life-threatening symptoms generally emerge from this, no fatalities from DSP have ever been recorded.See also[edit]Amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP)Neurotoxic shellfish poisoning (NSP)Paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP)Harmful algal blooms (HABs)References[edit]^ .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}Dawson, JF; Holmes CF (Oct 1999). \"Molecular mechanisms underlying inhibition of protein phosphatases by marine toxins\".
