       "   'text': 'Cyclic vomiting syndrome is a disorder that causes recurrent episodes of nausea, vomiting, and tiredness (lethargy). This condition is diagnosed most often in young children, but it can affect people of any age.The episodes of nausea, vomiting, and lethargy last anywhere from an hour to 10 days. An affected person may vomit several times per hour, potentially leading to a dangerous loss of fluids (dehydration). Additional symptoms can include unusually pale skin (pallor), abdominal pain, diarrhea, headache, fever, and an increased sensitivity to light (photophobia) or to sound (phonophobia). In most affected people, the signs and symptoms of each attack are quite similar. These attacks can be debilitating, making it difficult for an affected person to go to work or school.Episodes of nausea, vomiting, and lethargy can occur regularly or apparently at random, or can be triggered by a variety of factors. The most common triggers are emotional excitement and infections. Other triggers can include periods without eating (fasting), temperature extremes, lack of sleep, overexertion, allergies, ingesting certain foods or alcohol, and menstruation.If the condition is not treated, episodes usually occur four to 12 times per year. Between attacks, vomiting is absent, and nausea is either absent or much reduced. However, many affected people experience other symptoms during and between episodes, including pain, lethargy, digestive disorders such as gastroesophageal reflux and irritable bowel syndrome, and fainting spells (syncope). People with cyclic vomiting syndrome are also more likely than people without the disorder to experience depression, anxiety, and panic disorder. It is unclear whether these health conditions are directly related to nausea and vomiting.Cyclic vomiting syndrome is often considered to be a variant of migraines, which are severe headaches often associated with pain, nausea, vomiting, and extreme sensitivity to light and sound. Cyclic vomiting syndrome is likely the same as or closely related to a condition called abdominal migraine, which is characterized by attacks of stomach pain and cramping. Attacks of nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain in childhood may be replaced by migraine headaches as an affected person gets older. Many people with cyclic vomiting syndrome or abdominal migraine have a family history of migraines.Most people with cyclic vomiting syndrome have normal intelligence, although some affected people have developmental delay or intellectual disability. Autism spectrum disorder, which affects communication and social interaction, have also been associated with cyclic vomiting syndrome. Additionally, muscle weakness (myopathy) and seizures are possible. People with any of these additional features are said to have cyclic vomiting syndrome plus.FrequencyThe exact prevalence of cyclic vomiting syndrome is unknown; estimates range from 4 to 2,000 per 100,000 children. The condition is diagnosed less frequently in adults, although recent studies suggest that the condition may begin in adulthood as commonly as it begins in childhood.CausesAlthough the causes of cyclic vomiting syndrome have yet to be determined, researchers have proposed several factors that may contribute to the disorder. These factors include changes in brain function, hormonal abnormalities, and gastrointestinal problems. Many researchers believe that cyclic vomiting syndrome is a migraine-like condition, which suggests that it is related to changes in signaling between nerve cells (neurons) in certain areas of the brain. Many affected individuals have abnormalities of the autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary body functions such as heart rate, blood pressure, and digestion. Based on these abnormalities, cyclic vomiting syndrome is often classified as a type of dysautonomia.Some cases of cyclic vomiting syndrome, particularly those that begin in childhood, may be related to changes in mitochondrial DNA. Mitochondria are structures within cells that convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use. Although most DNA is packaged in chromosomes within the nucleus, mitochondria also have a small amount of their own DNA (known as mitochondrial DNA or mtDNA).Several changes in mitochondrial DNA have been associated with cyclic vomiting syndrome. Some of these changes alter single DNA building blocks (nucleotides), whereas others rearrange larger segments of mitochondrial DNA. These changes likely impair the ability of mitochondria to produce energy. Researchers speculate that the impaired mitochondria may cause certain cells of the autonomic nervous system to malfunction, which could affect the digestive system. However, it remains unclear how changes in mitochondrial function could cause episodes of nausea, vomiting, and lethargy; abdominal pain; or migraines in people with this condition.Learn more about the chromosome associated with Cyclic vomiting syndromemitochondrial dnaInheritance PatternIn most cases of cyclic vomiting syndrome, affected people have no known history of the disorder in their family. However, many affected individuals have a family history of related conditions, such as migraines, irritable bowel syndrome, or depression, in their mothers and other maternal relatives. This family history suggests an inheritance pattern known as maternal inheritance or mitochondrial inheritance, which applies to genes contained in mtDNA. Because egg cells, but not sperm cells, contribute mitochondria to the developing embryo, children can only inherit disorders resulting from mtDNA mutations from their mother. These disorders can appear in every generation of a family and can affect both males and females, but fathers do not pass traits associated with changes in mtDNA to their children.Occasionally, people with cyclic vomiting syndrome have a family history of the disorder that does not follow maternal inheritance. In these cases, the inheritance pattern is unknown.'},\n",

       "   'text': 'Chronic diarrhea of infancyOther namesToddler\\'s diarrheaSpecialtyPediatricsChronic diarrhea (alternate spelling: diarrhoea) of infancy, also called toddler\\'s diarrhea, is a common condition typically affecting up to 1.7 billion children between ages 6–30 months worldwide every year, usually resolving by age4.[1][2] According to the World Health Organization (WHO), diarrheal disease is the second greatest cause of death in children 5 years and younger. Diarrheal disease takes the lives of 525,000 or more children per year.[2] Diarrhea is characterized as the condition of passing of three or more loose or watery bowel movements within a day sometimes with undigested food visible. Diarrhea is separated into three clinical categories; acute diarrhea may last multiple hours or days, acute bloody diarrhea, also known as dysentery, and finally, chronic or persistent diarrhea which lasts 2–4 weeks or more.[2] There is normal growth with no evidence of malnutrition in the child experiencing persistent diarrhea. In chronic diarrhea there is no evidence of blood in the stool and there is no sign of infection. The condition may be related to irritable bowel syndrome.[1] There are various tests that can be performed to rule out other causes of diarrhea that don\\'t fall under the chronic criteria, including blood test, colonoscopy, and even genetic testing.[3][4] Most acute or severe cases of diarrhea have treatment guidelines revolving around prescription or non prescription (also known as over the counter or OTC) medications based on the cause, but the treatment protocols for chronic diarrhea focus on replenishing the body with lost fluids and electrolytes, because there typically isn\\'t a treatable cause.[5]Contents1 Signs and Symptoms1.1 Complications2 Cause3 Diagnosis3.1 Diagnostic Tests3.1.1 Genetic Testing4 Treatment and Management5 Epidemiology6 ReferencesSigns and Symptoms[edit]Toddler\\'s diarrhea is characterized by three or more watery stools per day that persist for 2–4 weeks or more.[2][6] Newborns and infants may normally have soft and frequent stools; however, any noticeable changes in stool frequency or form (i.e. watery) can indicate toddler\\'s diarrhea.[7] Other symptoms may include chills, fever, abdominal pain or cramping, nausea, and/or vomiting.[6] Undigested food and/or mucus may also be observed in stools.[8] More serious symptoms may include bloody stools, weight loss, greasy stools, and/or severe abdominal pain.[9]Aside from these signs and symptoms, infants and children present as healthy individuals with appropriate weight gain (considering sufficient calorie intake), active lifestyles, and normal appetites.[10][11]Complications[edit]Possible complications associated with toddler\\'s diarrhea include malabsorption and dehydration.Malabsorption affects the small intestine and results in the impaired absorption of important nutrients from an infant or child\\'s diet, leading to malnutrition. Malabsorption is indicated by symptoms of bloating, appetite changes, weight loss, and/or gas.[6]Dehydration occurs when there is not enough fluid intake to compensate for increased loss of fluid and electrolytes that may result from chronic diarrhea.[7] Dehydration is indicated by symptoms of thirst, absence of tears when crying, infrequent urination, dry mouth, and/or decreased energy.[6]Cause[edit]Diarrhea happens when the amount of fluids absorbed in the intestine does not match the amount secreted. The imbalance can be achieved in two ways: an excess of secretion or a lack of absorption. Thus, diarrhea can be categorized into secretory diarrhea, an excess of secretion, or osmotic diarrhea which is a lack of absorption. Usually both categories are present in chronic diarrhea of infants.[12]Secretory diarrhea can be caused by either infectious or non-infectious agents. Infectious agents include bacteria, viruses, and protozoans while non-infectious agents can be hormones, neurotransmitters, cytokines, and others. Osmotic diarrhea occurs when nutrients that are not absorbed exists in the intestines, typically due to damage to the intestines. The nutrients that are unable to be absorbed in the intestines draws water to itself.[12]Some factors that lead to chronic diarrhea of infancy:[9]Underdeveloped digestive system, nutrients do not spend adequate time in the digestive tract for water to be absorbed which leads to diarrhea.[9]Imbalanced Diet - a diet that has excess fiber and/or a lack of fat, fat can slow down the digestion process and prolong the amount of time nutrients spend in the tract which increases absorption. Fiber can lead to diarrhea because it shortens the amount of time food spends in the intestines, decreasing absorption.[9]Inability to absorb carbohydratesThe specific source of chronic diarrhea typically depends on the age of the infant/child. Diarrhea is uncommon for newborns; consequently, its presence in newborns could indicate a congenital disorder which would need hospitalization. Rare causes of chronic diarrhea in young children include a group of genetic mutations known as \"congenital diarrhea and enteropathies\" (CODEs). This group of genetic disorders usually presents in the first weeks of birth as severe and debilitating diarrhea and can lead to malabsorption, growth failure, and difficulty feeding.[13] CODEs are rare genetic changes to a single gene that affects the lining of the intestine or changes to the immune system that also affects the cell function of important nutrient and electrolyte transporters in the intestine such as Cl−/HCO3− mutation.[13]Otherwise, socioeconomic factors and access to treatment/healthcare play a significant part in developing chronic diarrhea as an infant. For instance, leading causes of chronic diarrhea in developing countries are infections of the intestine. In developed countries, chronic diarrhea has a diverse range of causes such as chronic infection of the intestines, autoimmune enteropathy, and inability to absorb nutrients via celiac disease, food sensitivities, etc.[12]From age 0–30 days, typical causes are:[12]Abetalipoproteinemia, a condition caused by a genetic mutation that creates abnormal absorption of fats and some vitamins.[14][15]Acrodermatitis enteropathica, a condition in which the intestine cannot absorb zinc.[16]Autoimmune enteropathy, a rare condition in which the intestines are perceived as a foreign threat by the immune system and are attacked leading to irritation and inflammation.[17][18]Microvillous inclusion disease, a condition caused by a genetic mutation leading to severe diarrhea because intestinal cells did not have normal development and thus the intestines are not able to absorb nutrients properly.[19][20]Congenital chloride diarrhea, a lifelong condition caused by a genetic mutation that leads to diarrhea with a high concentration of chloride.[21]Congenital sodium diarrhea, a genetic disorder caused by mutations in electrolyte transporters that disrupt the transport of Na+ across the intestine and results in high levels of Na+ greater than 145 mM in the stool.[13]Congenital short-bowel syndrome, a condition in which a portion of the small intestine is absent or not functioning properly leading to decreased absorption of both fluids and nutrients.[22]Congenital lactase deficiency, a condition caused by a genetic mutation in which the body cannot digest lactose properly.[23]Glucose-galactose malabsorption, a genetic disorder caused by changes in a protein critical for the transport of glucose and galactose across the intestine which leads to impaired glucose/galactose absorption, dehydration, and severe diarrhea in young children.[13][24] Typically, the severe diarrhea improves with a diet low in glucose/galactose and the tolerability to glucose/galactose improves with age.[13][25]Hirschsprung\\'s disease (HSCR), a gut motility disorder characterized by a lack of nerve cells in the large intestine which are needed to move the stool through the digestive tract.[26][27] In infants, HSCR typically presents when a newborn is unable to pass the first feces, or meconium within 48 hours of birth.[26] Other symptoms include blockage of the intestine, fever, rapid release of stool and flatulence upon rectal examination, and may present with diarrhea in infants.[26][27]Intestinal pseudo-obstruction (IPO), a gut motility disorder characterized by the inability to contract intestinal walls with symptoms similar to intestinal obstruction but lack a distinguishable cause of obstruction.[28][29] Signs and symptoms include abdominal pain, dilated or enlarged bowel, constipation and may include diarrhea.[28] Although rare in infants, IPO is a type of congenital disorder that may present with diarrhea in infants.[30]Primary bile acid malabsorption, a gut defect in the reabsorption of bile acids in the small intestine which results in increased levels of bile acids in the colon leading to watery diarrhea and bloating.[31]Chronic infection of C. difficile, G. lambliaC. difficile - bacteria that can be the source of diarrhea.[32]G. lamblia - a parasite that can be the source diarrhea.[33]From 1–12 months, typical causes of chronic diarrhea are the following:Acrodermatitis enteropathica, a condition in which the intestine cannot absorb zinc.[16]Cystic fibrosis, a condition caused by a genetic mutation that can lead to injury to the body\\'s organs including the lungs and those in the digestive system.[34][35]Apple juice and pear nectar, the digestive tract of children have difficulty absorbing significant quantities of sugars and carbohydrates which certain fruit juices can have.[9][12]Celiac Disease, a disorder in which there is an immune response to eating gluten which can eventually cause damage to the small intestine over time and impedes absorption.[36][37]Food allergy.[12]Most instances of chronic diarrhea in infancy are caused by infectious and post infectious disease of the intestine as well as food sensitivities or allergies.[38]Diagnosis[edit]Diagnosis of toddler\\'s diarrhea involves the evaluation of history of present illness, any relevant past medical history, and physical examination to determine any causative factors to inform treatment regimens and further recommendations.[39]Evaluation of history of present illness includes:[39]Stool characterization (i.e. appearance, consistency, frequency, etc.)Time frame and duration (important for differentiation between acute and chronic diarrhea)Food/drink allergies or restrictions (e.g. lactose intolerance)Medications, especially antibioticsInfection exposure (e.g. travel)Evaluation of past medical history includes:[39]Family historyConditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, cystic fibrosis, and celiac diseasePhysical examination involves:[39]Abdominal examination (tenderness, distention, and/or bowel sounds)Genital examination (rashes, anal fissures, and/or ulcerative lesions)General assessment and vital signs (any signs of dehydration such as tachycardia and low blood pressure)Examination of extremities and head (any signs of dehydration such as dry mucous membranes and skin turgor)Diagnostic Tests[edit]The following tests can also be performed to assist in the diagnosis of toddler\\'s diarrhea and evaluation of any associated complications/underlying conditions:[6][4]Stool tests provide further information about bleeding, infectious agents, and/or anatomical problems.Blood tests allow assessment of inflammatory markers and/or other criterion for causative diseases.X-rays provide evaluations of any problems that may originate in the gastrointestinal tract/liver/etc.Upper endoscopy or colonoscopy allows visualization of the gastrointestinal tract to assess location of inflammation.Breath hydrogen tests are utilized to determine lactose, fructose, and/or sucrose intolerance. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) may also be indicated by this test.Genetic Testing[edit]Most commonly, chronic diarrhea in infants and children are classified as acquired diarrhea, identified with the general diagnostic tests mentioned above. The other classification of chronic diarrhea, congenital diarrheas and enteropathies (CODEs), are rare diagnoses of exclusion. With recent advances in genome sequencing, the addition of targeted genetic testing to diagnostic algorithms has been proposed to allow faster diagnoses and earlier treatment of CODEs.[13] While certain genes and mutations have been associated with various CODEs, further research and studies are necessary to support the role of diagnostic genetic testing.[3]Treatment and Management[edit]According to doctors of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), treating the cause of chronic diarrhea in infants is primarily through diet (e.g. avoiding foods their bodies don\\'t tolerate such as gluten, lactose, fructose, and sucrose).[40][41][42] Dietary fiber and fat can be increased and fluid intake, especially fruit juice intake, decreased. With these considerations, NIDDK doctors recommend that children consume a normal balanced diet based on their age to avoid malnutrition or growth restriction.[1][43]Non-prescription medications such as loperamide are not recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for children below 6 years of age as they don\\'t address the underlying cause of the condition.[39][43] According to Benjamin Ortiz, M.D., a pediatrician in the Food and Drug Administration\\'s Office of Pediatric Therapeutics, bismuth subsalicylate is not recommended in children below 12 years of age because its contents, including magnesium, aluminum, and bismuth, are not readily cleared from their bodies, making them more susceptible to harm.[44]Studies have shown that certain probiotic preparations such as Lactobacillus rhamnosus (a bacterium) and Saccharomyces boulardii (a yeast) may be effective at reducing the duration and severity of diarrhea in acute settings as a result of gastroenteritis, while other studies have found that the use of probiotics doesn\\'t have an effect on the length of diarrhea in toddlers.[45][46][47]While treatments for chronic diarrhea of infancy aren\\'t clear cut, it is crucial to address the complications of dehydration that may arise from chronic diarrhea with the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines recommendation of oral rehydration therapy (ORT).[5] Oral rehydration solution (ORS), recommended by both AAP and the World Health Organization (WHO), must be composed of 50-90mEq/L sodium and 2% glucose or other complex carbohydrates.[39] ORS is easily found in the US because it is available without a prescription. The typical amount of ORS administered is 50mL/kg over a 4 hour time period for mild dehydration and 100mL/kg over a 4 hour time period for moderate dehydration with an extra 10mL/kg for every loose stool. Repeat this administration regimen for as long as the signs and symptoms of dehydration continue.[48] It is important to take measures early on to maintain hydration. Along with ORT, WHO recommends a 10-14 day course of 20mg zinc tablet supplementation, stating it will shorten the length of diarrhea and potentially improving harmful outcomes.[2]The NIDDK recommends a visit to the doctor when a child experiences stools containing pus or blood (black, tarry, or coffee ground-like appearance), signs of dehydration, diarrhea longer that 24 hours, or a fever of 102 degrees or more.[44]Epidemiology[edit]Diarrheal illness in children accounts for 1.5 to 2.5 million deaths per year worldwide.[39] It is responsible for the secondary cause of mortality among children less than 5 years of age surpassing the combined childhood deaths from malaria, measles, and AIDS.[49][50] In 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO)/United Nations International Children\\'s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) reported 2.5 billion cases of diarrhea in children less than 5 years old.[49] More than half of the cases occurred in Africa and South Asia. It is estimated that Africa and South Asia comprise more than 80% of deaths from diarrhea in children.[49] In fact, about 75% of the childhood deaths from diarrhea come from only 15 countries.[49] According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the proportion of deaths attributable to diarrheal illness among children less than 5 years of age was 13.2% in 2002.[51] Half of these childhood deaths were due to chronic diarrheal causes.Worldwide, studies estimate that diarrheal illness affects 3 to 20% of children under the age of 5 with an incidence of 2.7 episodes of diarrhea per child-year.[52][53] Developing nations experience higher burden of disease and mortality from chronic diarrhea in children compared to developed nations.[49] In the United States, it is reported that 15 to 20% of young children have an episode of acute diarrhea each year. Compared to worldwide estimates, the United States has a lower incidence rate of chronic diarrhea in young children reported at 0.18 episodes per child year.[54] In pediatrics, diarrhea is a common complaint making up 9% of U.S. hospital visits for children less than 5 years old.[39] In contrast to resource-poor nations, resource-rich nations such as the United States experience less chronic diarrhea severity. In the United States, approximately a quarter of chronic diarrhea cases in young children seek medical care and less than 1% of cases are hospitalized.[54][55]References[edit]^ a b c .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}Schwab J. \"Toddler\\'s Diarrhea (online course materials)\".

       "   'text': 'A number sign (#) is used with this entry because of evidence that susceptibility to acute infection-induced (herpes-specific) encephalopathy-7 (IIAE7) is caused by heterozygous mutation in the IRF3 gene (603734) on chromosome 19q13.For a phenotypic description of herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) and a discussion of genetic heterogeneity of susceptibility to acute infection-induced encephalopathy, see 610551.Clinical FeaturesAndersen et al. (2015) reported a 15-year-old girl of Danish descent with herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis. After a week of headache, fever, and confusion, she developed nuchal rigidity, impaired consciousness, and seizures. Cerebrospinal fluid showed mononuclear pleocytosis and was positive for HSV-1. The patient had no previous history of increased susceptibility to infections; she had had routine childhood immunizations with no adverse events.Mork et al. (2015) reported a 34-year-old Danish man who developed adult-onset HSE. He had continued mild neurologic deficits, but no history of other severe infections. Clinical details were limited.InheritanceThe transmission pattern of herpes simplex encephalitis in the family reported by Andersen et al. (2015) was consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance.Molecular GeneticsIn a 15-year-old girl of Danish descent with herpes simplex encephalitis, Andersen et al. (2015) identified a heterozygous missense mutation in the IRF3 gene (R285Q; 603734.0001). The mutation, which was found by whole-exome sequencing, was also present in the unaffected father, consistent with incomplete penetrance. Patient peripheral blood cells showed normal expression of the mutant protein, but significantly impaired interferon (see, e.g., IFNB1, 147640) response upon stimulation with synthetic pathogen-associated molecular patterns as well as variably decreased responses to HSV-1, HSV-2, and HSV-8 compared to controls. In vitro functional expression assays in HEK293 cells showed that the mutant protein was not properly phosphorylated at S386 and did not form homodimers upon infection or pathway-specific stimulation. The TLR3 (603029)/TRIF (607601) pathway was most affected. There was no evidence of a dominant-negative effect, and Andersen et al. (2015) postulated that haploinsufficiency was responsible for the phenotype. Expression of wildtype IRF3 in patient cells restored the ability to express IFNB1 in response to infection.In a 34-year-old Danish man (P2) with adult-onset herpes simplex encephalitis, Mork et al. (2015) identified a heterozygous missense mutation in the IRF3 gene (A277T; 603734.0002). The mutation was found by whole-exome sequencing of a cohort of 16 patients with adult-onset HSE (including the patient reported by Andersen et al., 2015) and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed significantly lower IFNB1, CXCL10 (147310), and TNFA (191160) responses to poly(I;C) stimulation and/or HSV-1 infection compared to controls, suggesting defective antiviral response and a loss of function. The findings suggested that IRF3 variants may also contribute to HSE susceptibility in adults.Animal ModelMenachery et al. (2010) found that Irf3-null mice had impaired ability to control HSV-1 replication in brain tissue following corneal or intracranial infection compared to wildtype mice. Irf3-null mice had an increased inflammatory cytokine response and decreased interferon production in the brain, resulting in increased lethality. These findings demonstrated a critical role for IRF3 in the control of central nervous system infection following HSV-1 challenge.INHERITANCE- Autosomal dominantNEUROLOGICCentral Nervous System- Acute infectious encephalitis- Headache- Fluctuating consciousness- Seizures- Nuchal rigidity- Residual neurologic deficits may occur- Encephalitis seen on MRIIMMUNOLOGY- Increased susceptibility to herpes encephalitis (HSV-1)MISCELLANEOUS- Variable age at onset, range teens to adult- Two unrelated patients have been reported (last curated March 2018)MOLECULAR BASIS- Caused by mutation in the interferon regulatory factor-3 gene (IRF3,603734.0001)▲Close'},\n",

Since the electron transport is an essential part of cellular respiration, its blockade can result in cell damage. In addition, the presence of chloramphenicol weakens the binding of bilirubin and albumin, so increased levels of the drug can lead to high levels of free bilirubin in the blood, resulting in brain damage or kernicterus.[2] Diagnosis[edit]Gray baby syndrome should be suspected in a new born with abdominal distension, progressive pallid cyanosis, irregular respirations, and refusal to breastfeed. The cause of gray baby syndrome comes from the mother\\'s use of an antibiotic, chloramphenicol, during pregnancy or breastfeeding. The presentation of symptoms can depend on the level of exposure of the drug to the baby. A broad diagnosis is usually needed for babies who present with cyanosis. Blood work is done to determine the level of serum chloramphenicol. Other tools used to help with diagnosis include CT scans, ultrasound, and electrocardiogram.[2]This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it.(March 2018)Prevention[edit]The condition can be prevented by using chloramphenicol at the recommended doses and monitoring blood levels,[4][5][6] or alternatively, third generation cephalosporins can be effectively substituted for the drug, without the associated toxicity.[7]If maternal use of chloramphenicol cannot be avoided, close monitoring of the baby\\'s symptoms such as feeding difficulties, and blood work is recommended.[8] Treatment[edit]Chloramphenicol therapy should be stopped immediately. Exchange transfusion may be required to remove the drug. Sometimes, phenobarbital to induce UDP-glucuronyltransferase enzyme is used.References[edit]^ .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}McIntyre J, Choonara I (2004). \"Drug toxicity in the neonate\".

Excessive salivation, also known as sialorrhea gravidarum, is another symptom experienced by some women.Hyperemesis gravidarum tends to occur in the first trimester of pregnancy[12] and lasts significantly longer than morning sickness. While most women will experience near-complete relief of morning sickness symptoms near the beginning of their second trimester, some sufferers of HG will experience severe symptoms until they give birth to their baby, and sometimes even after giving birth.[15]A small percentage rarely vomit, but the nausea still causes most (if not all) of the same issues that hyperemesis with vomiting does.[citation needed]Causes[edit]There are numerous theories regarding the cause of HG, but the cause remains controversial. It is thought that HG is due to a combination of factors which may vary between women and include genetics.[11] Women with family members who had HG are more likely to develop the disease.[16]One factor is an adverse reaction to the hormonal changes of pregnancy, in particular, elevated levels of beta human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG).[17][18] This theory would also explain why hyperemesis gravidarum is most frequently encountered in the first trimester (often around 8–12 weeks of gestation), as β-hCG levels are highest at that time and decline afterward. Another postulated cause of HG is an increase in maternal levels of estrogens (decreasing intestinal motility and gastric emptying leading to nausea/vomiting).[11]Pathophysiology[edit]Morning sicknessAlthough the pathophysiology of HG is poorly understood, the most commonly accepted theory suggests that levels of β-hCG are associated with it.[5] Leptin, a hormone that inhibits hunger, may also play a role.[19]Possible pathophysiological processes involved are summarized in the following table:[20]SourceCausePathophysiologyPlacentaβ-hCGDistention of the gastrointestinal tractCrossover with TSH, causing gestational thyrotoxicosis[5]PlacentaCorpus luteumEstrogenProgesteroneDecreased gut mobilityElevated liver enzymesDecreased lower esophageal sphincter pressureIncreased levels of sex steroids in hepatic portal system[21]Gastrointestinal tractHelicobacter pyloriIncreased steroid levels in circulation[22]Diagnosis[edit]Hyperemesis gravidarum is considered a diagnosis of exclusion.[11] HG can be associated with serious problems in the mother or baby, such as Wernicke\\'s encephalopathy, coagulopathy and peripheral neuropathy.[5]Women experiencing hyperemesis gravidarum often are dehydrated and lose weight despite efforts to eat.[23][24] The onset of the nausea and vomiting in hyperemesis gravidarum is typically before the 20th week of pregnancy.[11]Differential diagnosis[edit]Diagnoses to be ruled out include the following:[20]TypeDifferential diagnosesInfections(usually accompanied by fever or associated neurological symptoms)Urinary tract infectionHepatitisMeningitisGastroenteritisGastrointestinal disorders(usually accompanied by abdominal pain)AppendicitisCholecystitisPancreatitisFatty liverPeptic ulcerSmall bowel obstructionMetabolicThyrotoxicosis (common in Asian subcontinent)[5]Addison\\'s diseaseDiabetic ketoacidosisHyperparathyroidismDrugsAntibioticsIron supplementsGestational trophoblastic diseases (rule out with urine β-hCG)Molar pregnancyChoriocarcinomaInvestigations[edit]Common investigations include blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and electrolytes, liver function tests, urinalysis,[24] and thyroid function tests. Hematological investigations include hematocrit levels, which are usually raised in HG.[24] An ultrasound scan may be needed to know gestational status and to exclude molar or partial molar pregnancy.[25]Management[edit]Dry bland food and oral rehydration are first-line treatments.[26] Due to the potential for severe dehydration and other complications, HG is treated as an emergency. If conservative dietary measures fail, more extensive treatment such as the use of antiemetic medications and intravenous rehydration may be required. If oral nutrition is insufficient, intravenous nutritional support may be needed.[12] For women who require hospital admission, thromboembolic stockings or low-molecular-weight heparin may be used as measures to prevent the formation of a blood clot.[20]Intravenous fluids[edit]Intravenous (IV) hydration often includes supplementation of electrolytes as persistent vomiting frequently leads to a deficiency. Likewise, supplementation for lost thiamine (Vitamin B1) must be considered to reduce the risk of Wernicke\\'s encephalopathy.[27] A and B vitamins are depleted within two weeks, so extended malnutrition indicates a need for evaluation and supplementation. In addition, electrolyte levels should be monitored and supplemented; of particular concern are sodium and potassium.After IV rehydration is completed, patients typically begin to tolerate frequent small liquid or bland meals. After rehydration, treatment focuses on managing symptoms to allow normal intake of food. However, cycles of hydration and dehydration can occur, making continuing care necessary. Home care is available in the form of a peripherally-inserted central catheter (PICC) line for hydration and nutrition.[28]Home treatment is often less expensive and reduces the risk for a hospital-acquired infection compared with long-term or repeated hospitalizations.Medications[edit]A number of antiemetics are effective and safe in pregnancy including: pyridoxine/doxylamine, antihistamines (such as diphenhydramine), and phenothiazines (such as promethazine).[29] With respect to effectiveness, it is unknown if one is superior to another for relieving nausea or vomiting.[29] Limited evidence from published clinical trials suggests the use of medications to treat hyperemesis gravidarum.[30]While pyridoxine/doxylamine, a combination of vitamin B6 and doxylamine, is effective in nausea and vomiting of pregnancy,[31] some have questioned its effectiveness in HG.[32]Ondansetron may be beneficial, however, there are some concerns regarding an association with cleft palate,[33] and there is little high-quality data.[29] Metoclopramide is also used and relatively well tolerated.[34] Evidence for the use of corticosteroids is weak; there is some evidence that corticosteroid use in pregnant women may slightly increase the risk of cleft lip and cleft palate in the infant and may suppress fetal adrenal activity.[11][35] However, hydrocortisone and prednisolone are inactivated in the placenta and may be used in the treatment of hyperemesis gravidarum after 12 weeks.[11]Nutritional support[edit]Women not responding to IV rehydration and medication may require nutritional support. Patients might receive parenteral nutrition (intravenous feeding via a PICC line) or enteral nutrition (via a nasogastric tube or a nasojejunal tube). There is only limited evidence from trials to support the use of vitamin B6 to improve outcome.[30] An oversupply of nutrition (hyperalimentation) may be necessary in certain cases to help maintain volume requirements and allow weight gain.[25] A physician might also prescribe Vitamin B1 (to prevent Wernicke\\'s encephalopathy) and folic acid.[20]Alternative medicine[edit]Acupuncture (both with P6 and traditional method) has been found to be ineffective.[30] The use of ginger products may be helpful, but evidence of effectiveness is limited and inconsistent, though three recent studies support ginger over placebo.[30]While generally considered harmful, medical cannabis has been reported to be used in self-medication to treat pregnancy-associated hyperemesis.[36]Complications[edit]Pregnant woman[edit]If HG is inadequately treated, anemia,[11] hyponatremia,[11] Wernicke\\'s encephalopathy,[11] kidney failure, central pontine myelinolysis, coagulopathy, atrophy, Mallory-Weiss tears,[11] hypoglycemia, jaundice, malnutrition, pneumomediastinum, rhabdomyolysis, deconditioning, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, splenic avulsion, or vasospasms of cerebral arteries are possible consequences. Depression and post-traumatic stress disorder[37] are common secondary complications of HG and emotional support can be beneficial.[11]Infant[edit]The effects of HG on the fetus are mainly due to electrolyte imbalances caused by HG in the mother.[20] Infants of women with severe hyperemesis who gain less than 7 kilograms (15lb) during pregnancy tend to be of lower birth weight, small for gestational age, and born before 37 weeks gestation.[12] In contrast, infants of women with hyperemesis who have a pregnancy weight gain of more than 7kilograms appear similar to infants from uncomplicated pregnancies.[38] There is no significant difference in the neonatal death rate in infants born to mothers with HG compared to infants born to mothers who do not have HG.[11] Children born to mothers with undertreated HG have a fourfold increase in neurobehavioral diagnoses.[39]Epidemiology[edit]Vomiting is a common condition affecting about 50% of pregnant women, with another 25% having nausea.[40] However, the incidence of HG is only 0.3–1.5%.[5] After preterm labor, hyperemesis gravidarum is the second most common reason for hospital admission during the first half of pregnancy.[11] Factors, such as infection with Helicobacter pylori, a rise in thyroid hormone production, low age, low body mass index prior to pregnancy, multiple pregnancies, molar pregnancies, and a past history of hyperemesis gravidarum have been associated with the development of HG.[11]History[edit]Thalidomide was prescribed for treatment of HG in Europe until it was recognized that thalidomide is teratogenic and is a cause of phocomelia in neonates.[41]Etymology[edit]Hyperemesis gravidarum is from the Greek hyper-, meaning excessive, and emesis, meaning vomiting, and the Latin gravidarum, the feminine genitive plural form of an adjective, here used as a noun, meaning \"pregnant [woman]\". Therefore, hyperemesis gravidarum means \"excessive vomiting of pregnant women\".Notable cases[edit]Author Charlotte Brontë is often thought to have suffered from hyperemesis gravidarum. She died in 1855 while four months pregnant, having been afflicted by intractable nausea and vomiting throughout her pregnancy, and was unable to tolerate food or even water.[42]Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge was hospitalised due to hyperemesis gravidarum during her first pregnancy, and was treated for a similar condition during the subsequent two.[43][44]Comedienne Amy Schumer cancelled the remainder of a tour due to hyperemesis gravidarum.[45]References[edit]^ a b .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}\"Management of hyperemesis gravidarum\".

The child may also experience apnea, or brief pauses in breathing. After the acute illness, it is common for the airways to remain sensitive for several weeks, leading to recurrent cough and wheeze.Some signs of severe disease include:[10] poor feeding (less than half of usual fluid intake in preceding 24 hours)significantly decreased activityhistory of stopping breathingrespiratory rate >70/minpresence of nasal flaring and/or gruntingsevere chest wall recession (Hoover\\'s sign)bluish skinCauses[edit]Acute inflammatory exudate occluding the lumen of the bronchiole and acute inflammation of part of the wall of the bronchioleThe term usually refers to acute viral bronchiolitis, a common disease in infancy. This is most commonly caused by respiratory syncytial virus[11] (RSV, also known as human pneumovirus). Other agents that cause this illness include human metapneumovirus, influenza, parainfluenza, coronavirus, adenovirus, rhinovirus and mycoplasma.[12][13]Risk factors[edit]Children are at an increased risk for progression to severe respiratory disease if they have any of the following additional factors:[5][8][13][14]Preterm infant (gestational age less than 37 weeks)Younger age at onset of illness (less than 3 months of age)Congenital heart diseaseImmunodeficiencyChronic lung diseaseNeurological disordersTobacco smoke exposureDiagnosis[edit]WheezingWheezing heard in the lungs of an adult using a stethoscope. Similar sounds might be heard in a child with bronchiolitis.Problems playing this file? See media help.The diagnosis is typically made by clinical examination. Chest X-ray is sometimes useful to exclude bacterial pneumonia, but not indicated in routine cases.[15] Chest x-ray may also be useful in people with impending respiratory failure.[16] Additional testing such as blood cultures, complete blood count, and electrolyte analyses are not recommended for routine use although may be useful in children with multiple comorbidities or signs of sepsis or pneumonia.[5][16]Testing for the specific viral cause can be done but has little effect on management and thus is not routinely recommended.[15] RSV testing by direct immunofluorescence testing on nasopharyngeal aspirate had a sensitivity of 61% and specificity of 89%.[13][16] Identification of those who are RSV-positive can help for disease surveillance, grouping (\"cohorting\") people together in hospital wards to prevent cross infection, predicting whether the disease course has peaked yet, and reducing the need for other diagnostic procedures (by providing confidence that a cause has been identified).[5] Identification of the virus may help reduce the use of antibiotics.[16]Infants with bronchiolitis between the age of two and three months have a second infection by bacteria (usually a urinary tract infection) less than 6% of the time.[17] When further evaluated with a urinalysis, infants with bronchiolitis had a concomitant UTI 0.8% of the time.[18] Preliminary studies have suggested that elevated procalcitonin levels may assist clinicians in determining the presence of bacterial co-infection, which could prevent unnecessary antibiotic use and costs.[19]Differential diagnosis[edit]There are many childhood illnesses that can present with respiratory symptoms, particularly persistent cough and wheezing.[8][20] Bronchiolitis may be differentiated from some of these by the characteristic pattern of preceding febrile upper respiratory tract symptoms lasting for 1 to 3 days followed by the persistent cough, tachypnea, and wheezing.[20] However, some infants may present without fever (30% of cases) or may present with apnea without other signs or with poor weight gain prior to onset of symptoms.[20] In such cases, additional laboratory testing and radiographic imaging may be useful.[8][20] The following are some other diagnoses to consider in an infant presenting with signs of bronchiolitis:[citation needed]Asthma and reactive airway diseaseBacterial pneumoniaCongenital heart diseaseHeart failureWhooping coughAllergic reactionCystic fibrosisChronic pulmonary diseaseForeign body aspirationVascular ringPrevention[edit]Prevention of bronchiolitis relies strongly on measures to reduce the spread of the viruses that cause respiratory infections (that is, handwashing, and avoiding exposure to those symptomatic with respiratory infections).[5][8] Guidelines are mixed on the use of gloves, aprons, or personal protective equipment.[5] In addition to good hygiene, an improved immune system is a great tool for prevention.[citation needed]One way to improve the immune system is to feed the infant with breast milk, especially during the first month of life.[14][21] Respiratory infections were shown to be significantly less common among breastfed infants and fully breastfed RSV-positive hospitalized infants had shorter hospital stays than non or partially breastfed infants.[8] Guidelines recommend exclusive breastfeeding for infants for the first 6 months of life.[8]Palivizumab, a monoclonal antibody against RSV, can be administered to prevent bronchiolitis to infants less than one year of age that were born very prematurely or that have underlying heart disease or chronic lung disease of prematurity.[8] Passive immunization therapy requires monthly injections during winter.[8] Otherwise healthy premature infants that were born after a gestational age of 29 weeks should not be administered palivizumab as the harms outweigh the benefits.[8] Passive protection through the administration of other novel monoclonal antibodies is also under evaluation.[16]The development of immunizations for RSV are being developed but there are none available currently.[16][22]Tobacco smoke exposure has been shown to increase both the rates of lower respiratory disease in infants as well as the risk and severity of bronchiolitis.[8] Tobacco smoke lingers in the environment for prolonged periods and on clothing even when smoking outside the home.[8] Guidelines recommend that parents be fully educated on the risks of tobacco smoke exposure on children with bronchiolitis.[8][20]Management[edit]Treatment of bronchiolitis is usually focused on the hydration and symptoms instead of the infection itself since the infection will run its course and complications are typically from the symptoms themselves.[23] Without active treatment, half of cases will go away in 13 days and 90% in three weeks.[24] Children with severe symptoms, especially poor feeding or dehydration, may be considered for hospital admission.[5] Oxygen saturation under 90%-92% as measured with pulse oximetry is also frequently used as an indicator of need for hospitalization.[5] High-risk infants, apnea, cyanosis, malnutrition, and diagnostic uncertainty are additional indications for hospitalization.[5]Most guidelines recommend sufficient fluids and nutritional support for affected children.[5] Measures for which the recommendations were mixed include nebulized hypertonic saline, nebulized epinephrine, and nasal suctioning.[1][5][25][26] Treatments which the evidence does not support include salbutamol, steroids, antibiotics, antivirals, heliox, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), chest physiotherapy, and cool mist or steam inhalation.[1][27][28][29][30]Diet[edit]Maintaining hydration is an important part of management of bronchiolitis.[8][16][31] Infants with mild pulmonary symptoms may require only observation if feeding is unaffected.[8] However, oral intake may be affected by nasal secretions and increased work of breathing.[8] Poor feeding or dehydration, defined as less than 50% of usual intake, is often cited as an indication for hospital admission.[5] Guidelines recommend the use of nasogastric or intravenous fluids in children with bronchiolitis who cannot maintain usual oral intake.[8][20][16] The risk of health care caused hyponatremia and fluid retention are minimal with the use of isotonic fluids such as normal saline, breast milk, or formula.[8]Oxygen[edit]A newborn wearing a nasal CPAP device.Inadequate oxygen supply to the tissue is one of the main concerns during severe bronchiolitis and oxygen saturation is often closely associated with both the need for hospitalization and continued length of hospital stay in children with bronchiolitis.[16] However, oxygen saturation is a poor predictor of respiratory distress.[8] Accuracy of pulse oximetry is limited in the 76% to 90% range and there is weak correlation between oxygen saturation and respiratory distress as brief hypoxemia is common in healthy infants.[8][16] Additionally, pulse oximetry is associated with frequent false alarms and parental stress and fatigue.[8] Clinicians may choose not to given additional oxygen to children with bronchiolitis if their oxygen saturation is above 90%.[8][20][16] Additionally, clinicians may choose not to use continuous pulse oximetry in these people.[8]When choosing to use oxygen therapy for a child with bronchiolitis, there is evidence that home oxygen may reduce hospitalization rate and length of stay although readmission rates and follow-up visits are increased.[8] Also, the use of humidified, heated, high-flow nasal cannula may be a safe initial therapy to decrease work of breathing and need for intubation.[8][32] However, evidence is lacking regarding the use of high-flow nasal cannula compared to standard oxygen therapy or continuous positive airway pressure.[16][32][33] These practices may still be used in severe cases prior to intubation.[20][34][35]Blood gas testing is not recommended for people hospitalized with the disease and is not useful in the routine management of bronchiolitis.[16][20] People with severe worsening respiratory distress or impending respiratory failure may be considered for capillary blood gas testing.[20]Hypertonic saline[edit]Guidelines recommend against the use of nebulized hypertonic saline in the emergency department for children with bronchiolitis but it may be given to children who are hospitalized.[8][16]Nebulized hypertonic saline (3%) has limited evidence of benefit and previous studies lack consistency and standardization.[6][7][36][37] A 2017 review found tentative evidence that it reduces the risk of hospitalization, duration of hospital stay, and improved the severity of symptoms.[6][38] The majority of evidence suggests that hypertonic saline is safe and effective at improving respiratory symptoms of mild to moderate bronchiolitis after 24 hours of use.[39] However, it does not appear effective in reducing the rate of hospitalization when used in the emergency room or other outpatient settings in which length of therapy is brief.[8] Side effects were mild and resolved spontaneously.[6]Bronchodilators[edit]Guidelines recommend against the use of bronchodilators in children with bronchiolitis as evidence does not support a change in outcomes with such use.[8][20][40][41] Additionally, there are adverse effects to the use of bronchodilators in children such as tachycardia and tremors as well as adding increased financial expenses.[42][43]Several studies have shown that bronchodilation with β-adrenergic agents such as salbutamol may improve symptoms briefly but do not affect the overall course of the illness or reduce the need for hospitalization.[8] However, there are conflicting recommendations about the use of a trial of a bronchodilator, especially in those with history of previous wheezing, due to the difficulty with assessing an objective improvement in symptoms.[5][8][16] Bronchiolitis-associated wheezing is likely not effectively alleviated by bronchodilators anyway as it is caused by airway obstruction and plugging of the small airway diameters by luminal debris, not bronchospasm as in asthma-associated wheezing that bronchodilators usually treat well.[43]Anticholinergic inhalers, such as ipratropium bromide, have a modest short term effect at best and are not recommended for treatment.[20][44][45]Epinephrine[edit]The current state of evidence suggests that nebulized epinephrine is not indicated for children with bronchiolitis except as a trial of rescue therapy for severe cases.[8][20]Epinephrine is an α and β adrenergic agonist that has been used to treat other upper respiratory tract illnesses, such as croup, as a nebulized solution.[46] A Cochrane meta-analysis in 2011 found no benefit to the use of epinephrine in the inpatient setting and suggested that there may be utility in the outpatient setting in reducing the rate of hospitalization.[47][26] However, current guidelines do not support the outpatient use of epinephrine given the lack of substantial sustained benefit.[8]A 2017 review found inhaled epinephrine with corticosteroids did not change the need for hospitalization or the time spent in hospital.[48] Other studies suggest a synergistic effect of epinephrine with corticosteroids but have not consistently demonstrated benefits in clinical trials.[8] Guidelines recommend against its use currently.[8][5]Unclear evidence[edit]Currently other medications do not yet have evidence to support their use, although they have been studied for use in bronchiolitis.[8][49] Experimental trials with novel antiviral medications in adults are promising but it remains unclear if the same benefit will be present.[16]Surfactant had favorable effects for severely critical infants on duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay however studies were few and small.[50][12]Chest physiotherapy, such as vibration or percussion, to promote airway clearance may slightly reduce duration of oxygen therapy but there is a lack of evidence that demonstrates any other benefits.[8][51] People with difficulty clearing secretions due to underlying disorders such as spinal muscle atrophy or severe tracheomalacia may be considered for chest physiotherapy.[20]Suctioning of the nares may provide temporarily relief of nasal congestion but deep suctioning of the nasopharynx has been shown prolong length of hospital stay in infants.[8][20] Upper airway suctioning may be considered in people with respiratory distress, feeding difficulties, or infants presenting with apnea.[20]Heliox, a mixture of oxygen and the inert gas helium, may be beneficial in infants with severe acute RSV bronchiolitis who require CPAP but overall evidence is lacking.[52]DNAse has not been found to be effective but might play a role in severe bronchiolitis complicated by atelectasis.[53]There are no systematic reviews or controlled trials on the effectiveness of nasal decongestants, such as xylometazoline, for the treatment of bronchiolitits.[12]Overall evidence is insufficient to support the use of alternative medicine.[54] There is tentative evidence for Chinese herbal medicine, vitamin D, N-acetylcysteine, and magnesium but this is insufficient to recommend their use.[54]Non-effective treatments[edit]Ribavirin is an antiviral drug which does not appear to be effective for bronchiolitis.[55]Antibiotics are often given in case of a bacterial infection complicating bronchiolitis, but have no effect on the underlying viral infection and their benefit is not clear.[55][56][57][58] The risks of bronchiolitis with a concomitant serious bacterial infection among hospitalized febrile infants is minimal and work-up and antibiotics are not justified.[8][18] Azithromycin adjuvant therapy may reduce the duration of wheezing and coughing in children with bronchiolitis but has not effect on length of hospital stay or duration of oxygen therapy.[59]Corticosteroids, although useful in other respiratory disease such as asthma and croup, have no proven benefit in bronchiolitis treatment and are not advised.[8][5][55][60][61] Additionally, corticosteroid therapy in children with bronchiolitis may prolong viral shedding and transmissibility.[8] The overall safety of corticosteroids is questionable.[62]Leukotriene inhibitors, such as montelukast, have not been found to be beneficial and may increase adverse effects.[5][63][64][65]Immunoglobulins are of unclear benefit.[66]Epidemiology[edit]Bronchiolitis typically affects infants and children younger than two years, principally during the autumn and winter.[16] It is the leading cause of hospital admission for respiratory disease among infants in the United States and accounts for one out of every 13 primary care visits.[5] Bronchiolitis accounts for 3% of emergency department visits for children under 2 years old.[12] Bronchiolitis is the most frequent lower respiratory tract infection and hospitalization in infants worldwide.[16]References[edit]^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p .mw-parser-output

The first twin developed normally until the age of 25 months when, during sleep, she developed irregular respirations, perioral cyanosis, flaccidity, and urinary incontinence. Several other similar episodes followed during one of which the child died at the age of 27 months. The second twin first displayed sleep apnea at age 27 months, shortly after the death of her twin sister. She died after an apneic episode at the age of 31 months. A brother died at 18 months after a single episode of sleep apnea. The fourth affected sib, a girl, was evaluated for apneic tendency at 7 weeks of age, because of the experience with the previous 3 sibs. She was found to be affected. Between 2 and 31 months of age, numerous hospitalizations were required for apneic episodes, some with severe lactic acidosis. Inhibitor substance to thiamine triphosphate (TTP) was present in the urine. The child died at age 31 months as a result of a severe apneic spell. Adickes et al. (1986) concluded that this may be a form of subacute necrotizing encephalomyopathy (Leigh disease; 256000).

       "   'text': \"Benign familial neonatal seizures (BFNS) is a condition characterized by recurrent seizures in newborn babies. The seizures begin around day 3 of life and usually go away within 1 to 4 months. The seizures can involve only one side of the brain (focal seizures) or both sides (generalized seizures). Many infants with this condition have generalized tonic-clonic seizures (also known as grand mal seizures). This type of seizure involves both sides of the brain and affects the entire body, causing muscle rigidity, convulsions, and loss of consciousness.A test called an electroencephalogram (EEG) is used to measure the electrical activity of the brain. Abnormalities on an EEG test, measured during no seizure activity, can indicate a risk for seizures. However, infants with BFNS usually have normal EEG readings. In some affected individuals, the EEG shows a specific abnormality called the theta pointu alternant pattern. By age 2, most affected individuals who had EEG abnormalities have a normal EEG reading.Typically, seizures are the only symptom of BFNS, and most people with this condition develop normally. However, some affected individuals develop intellectual disability that becomes noticeable in early childhood. A small percentage of people with BFNS also have a condition called myokymia, which is an involuntary rippling movement of the muscles. In addition, in about 15 percent of people with BFNS, recurrent seizures (epilepsy) will come back later in life after the seizures associated with BFNS have gone away. The age that epilepsy begins is variable.FrequencyBenign familial neonatal seizures occurs in approximately 1 in 100,000 newborns.CausesMutations in two genes, KCNQ2 and KCNQ3, have been found to cause BFNS. Mutations in the KCNQ2 gene are a much more common cause of the condition than mutations in the KCNQ3 gene.The KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 genes provide instructions for making proteins that interact to form potassium channels. Potassium channels, which transport positively charged atoms (ions) of potassium into and out of cells, play a key role in a cell's ability to generate and transmit electrical signals.Channels made with the KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 proteins are active in nerve cells (neurons) in the brain, where they transport potassium ions out of cells. These channels transmit a particular type of electrical signal called the M-current, which prevents the neuron from continuing to send signals to other neurons. The M-current ensures that the neuron is not constantly active, or excitable.Mutations in the KCNQ2 or KCNQ3 gene result in a reduced or altered M-current, which leads to excessive excitability of neurons. Seizures develop when neurons in the brain are abnormally excited. It is unclear why the seizures stop around the age of 4 months. It has been suggested that potassium channels formed from the KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 proteins play a major role in preventing excessive excitability of neurons in newborns, but other mechanisms develop during infancy.About 70 percent of people with BFNS have a mutation in either the KCNQ2 or the KCNQ3 gene. Researchers are working to identify other gene mutations involved in this condition.Learn more about the genes associated with Benign familial neonatal seizuresKCNQ2KCNQ3Inheritance PatternThis condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. A few cases result from new mutations in the KCNQ2 gene. These cases occur in people with no history of benign familial neonatal seizures in their family.\"},\n",

Occlusion of the left popliteal artery was discovered. Laboratory investigations showed marked diminution in sensitivity of platelets to prostacyclin and a defect in platelet prostacyclin receptor (600022) was discovered. Because of reduction in the value of PGI2-receptor of the high affinity type in a brother and to some extent in both parents, the defect was thought to be hereditary. In 2 males, aged 35 and 38 years, presenting with myocardial infarction, Sinzinger et al. (1991) found abnormal conversion of exogenous 14C-arachidonic acid by platelets incubated in vitro. Neither of the patient's platelets showed evidence of a lipoxygenase pathway. Platelet thromboxane formation from exogenous and endogenous substrate was high, while the platelet aggregation responses were normal.

For the TV episode, see Pavor Nocturnus (Sanctuary).Night terrorOther namesSleep terror, pavor nocturnusSpecialtyPsychiatry, Sleep medicine, Clinical PsychologyNight terror, also known as sleep terror, is a sleep disorder causing feelings of panic or dread typically occurring during the first hours of stage 3–4 non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep[1] and lasting for 1 to 10 minutes.[2] They can last longer, especially in children.[2] Sleep terrors are classified in the category of NREM-related parasomnias in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders.[3] There are two other categories: REM-related parasomnias and other parasomnias.[3] Parasomnias are qualified as undesirable physical events or experiences that occur during entry into sleep, within sleep, or during arousal from sleep.[4]Sleep terrors usually begin in childhood and usually decrease with age.[2] Factors which may lead to sleep terrors are young age, sleep deprivation, medications, stress, fever, and intrinsic sleep disorders.[5] Though the frequency and severity differ between individuals, the episodes can occur in intervals of days or weeks, but can also occur over consecutive nights or multiple times in one night.[6] This has created a situation in which any type of nocturnal attack or nightmare may be confused with and reported as a night terror.[7]Night terrors tend to happen during periods of arousal from delta sleep, also known as slow-wave sleep.[8][7] Delta sleep occurs most often during the first half of a sleep cycle, which indicates that people with more delta-sleep activity are more prone to night terrors. However, they can also occur during daytime naps.[6] Night terrors can often be mistaken for confusional arousal.[8]While nightmares (bad dreams during REM sleep that cause feelings of horror or fear) are relatively common during childhood, night terrors occur less frequently.[9] The prevalence of sleep terrors in general is unknown.[2] The number of small children who experience sleep terror episodes (distinct from sleep terror disorder, which is recurrent and causes distress or impairment[2]) are estimated at 36.9% at 18 months of age and at 19.7% at 30 months.[2] In adults, the prevalence is lower, at only 2.2%.[2] Night terrors have been known since ancient times, although it was impossible to differentiate them from nightmares until rapid eye movement was studied.[7]Contents1 Signs and symptoms1.1 Children1.2 Adults2 Causes3 Diagnosis3.1 Differential diagnosis4 Assessment5 Treatment6 Research7 See also8 References9 External linksSigns and symptoms[edit]The universal feature of night terrors is inconsolability, very similar to that of a panic attack.[10] During night terror bouts, people are usually described as \"bolting upright\" with their eyes wide open and a look of fear and panic on their faces. They will often yell. Furthermore, they will usually sweat, exhibit rapid breathing, and have a rapid heart rate (autonomic signs). In some cases, individuals are likely to have even more elaborate motor activity, such as a thrashing of limbs—which may include punching, swinging, or fleeing motions. There is a sense that the individuals are trying to protect themselves and/or escape from a possible threat of bodily injury.[6] Although people may seem to be awake during a night terror, they will appear confused, be inconsolable and/or unresponsive to attempts to communicate with them, and may not recognize others familiar to them. Occasionally, when a person with a night terror is awakened, they will lash out at the one awakening them, which can be dangerous to that individual. Most people who experience this do not remember the incident the next day,[8] although brief dream images or hallucinations may occur and be recalled.[4] Sleepwalking is also common during night-terror bouts,[7][11] as sleepwalking and night terrors are different manifestations of the same parasomnia.[7] Both children and adults may display behaviour indicative of attempting to escape; some may get out of bed and begin running around aimlessly while inconsolable, increasing the risk of accidental injury.[12]During lab tests, subjects are known to have very high voltages of electroencephalography (EEG) delta activity, an increase in muscle tone, and a doubled or faster heart rate. Brain activities during a typical episode show theta and alpha activity when monitored with an EEG. Episodes can include tachycardia. Night terrors are also associated with intense autonomic discharge of tachypnea, flushing, diaphoresis, and mydriasis[10]—that is, unconscious or involuntary rapid breathing, reddening of the skin, profuse sweating, and dilation of the pupils. Abrupt but calmer arousal from NREM sleep, short of a full night-terror episode, is also common.In children with night terrors, there is no increased occurrence of psychiatric diagnoses.[13] However, in adults who suffer from night terrors there is a close association with psychopathology and mental disorders. There may be an increased occurrence of night terrors—particularly among those suffering or having suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). It is also likely that some personality disorders may occur in individuals with night terrors, such as dependent, schizoid, and borderline personality disorders.[13] There have been some symptoms of depression and anxiety that have increased in individuals that have suffered from frequent night terrors. Low blood sugar is associated with both pediatric and adult night terrors.[6][14][self-published source?] A study of adults with thalamic lesions of the brain and brainstem have been occasionally associated with night terrors.[15] Night terrors are closely linked to sleepwalking and frontal lobe epilepsy.[16]Children[edit]Night terrors typically occur in children between the ages of three and twelve years, with a peak onset in children aged three and a half years old.[17]An estimated 1–6% of children experience night terrors. Children of both genders and all ethnic backgrounds are affected equally.[17] In children younger than three and a half years old, peak frequency of night terrors is at least one episode per week. Among older children, peak frequency of night terrors is one or two episodes per month. The children will most likely have no recollection of the episode the next day. Pediatric evaluation may be sought to exclude the possibility that the night terrors are caused by seizure disorders or breathing problems.[17] Most children will outgrow sleep terrors.[18]Adults[edit]Night terrors in adults have been reported in all age ranges.[19] Though the symptoms of night terrors in adolescents and adults are similar, the cause, prognosis and treatment are qualitatively different. These night terrors can occur each night if the sufferer does not eat a proper diet, get the appropriate amount or quality of sleep (e.g. sleep apnea), is enduring stressful events, or if he or she remains untreated. Adult night terrors are much less common, and often respond to treatments to rectify causes of poor quality or quantity of sleep. Night terrors are classified as a mental and behavioral disorder in the ICD.[20] A study done about night terrors in adults showed that other psychiatric symptoms were prevalent in most patients experiencing night terrors hinting at the comorbidity of the two.[10] There is some evidence of a link between night terrors and hypoglycemia.[21]When a night terror happens, it is typical for a person to wake up yelling and kicking and to be able to recognize what he or she is saying. The person may even run out of the house (more common among adults) which can then lead to violent actions.[22] It has been found that some adults who have been on a long-term intrathecal clonidine therapy show side effects of night terrors, such as feelings of terror early in the sleep cycle.[23] This is due to the possible alteration of cervical/brain clonidine concentration.[19] In adults, night terrors can be symptomatic of neurological disease and can be further investigated through an MRI procedure.[24]Causes[edit]There is some evidence that a predisposition to night terrors and other parasomnias may be congenital. Individuals frequently report that past family members have had either episodes of sleep terrors or sleepwalking. In some studies, a ten-fold increase in the prevalence of night terrors in first-degree biological relatives has been observed—however, the exact link to inheritance is not known.[6] Familial aggregation has been found suggesting that there is an autosomal mode of inheritance.[10] In addition, some laboratory findings suggest that sleep deprivation and having a fever can increase the likelihood of a night terror episode occurring.[25] Other contributing factors include nocturnal asthma, gastroesophageal reflux, central nervous system medications,[10] and a constricted nasal passage.[26] Special consideration must be used when the subject suffers from narcolepsy, as there may be a link. There have been no findings that show a cultural difference between manifestations of night terrors, though it is thought that the significance and cause of night terrors differ within cultures. Also, older children and adults provide highly detailed and descriptive images associated with their sleep terrors compared to younger children, who either cannot recall or only vaguely remember. Sleep terrors in children are also more likely to occur in males than females; in adults, the ratio between sexes is equal.[6] A longitudinal study examined twins, both identical and fraternal, and found that a significantly higher concordance rate of night terror was found in identical twins than in fraternal.[10][27]Though the symptoms of night terrors in adolescents and adults are similar, their causes, prognoses, and treatments are qualitatively different. There is some evidence that suggests that night terrors can occur if the sufferer does not eat a proper diet, does not get the appropriate amount or quality of sleep (e.g., because of sleep apnea), or is enduring stressful events. Adults who have experienced sexual abuse are more likely to receive a diagnosis of sleep disorders, including night terrors.[28] Overall, though, adult night terrors are much less common and often respond best to treatments that rectify causes of poor quality or quantity of sleep.Diagnosis[edit]The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for sleep terror disorder requires:[2]Recurrent periods where the individual abruptly but not completely wakes from sleep, usually occurring during the first third major period of sleep.The individual experiences intense fear with a panicky scream at the beginning and symptoms of autonomic arousal, such as increased heart rate, heavy breathing, and increased perspiration. The individual cannot be soothed or comforted during the episode.The individual is unable or almost unable to remember images of the dream (only a single visual scene for example).The episode is completely forgotten.The occurrence of the sleep terror episode causes clinically significant distress or impairment in the individual\\'s functioning.The disturbance is not due to the effects of a substance, general medical condition or medication.Coexisting mental or medical disorders do not explain the episodes of sleep terrors.Differential diagnosis[edit]Night terrors are distinct from nightmares.[29] In fact, in nightmares there are almost never vocalization or agitation, and if there are any, they are less strong in comparison to night terrors.[29] In addition, nightmares appear ordinarily during REM sleep in contrast to night terrors, which occur in NREM sleep.[2] Finally, individuals with nightmares can wake up completely and easily and have clear and detailed memories of their dreams.[2][29]A distinction between night terrors and epileptic seizure is required.[29] Indeed, an epileptic seizure could happen during the night but also during the day.[29] To make the difference between both of them, an EEG can be done and if there are some anomalies on it, it would rather be an epileptic seizure.[29]Assessment[edit]The assessment of sleep terrors is similar to the assessment of other parasomnias and must include:[30]When the episode occurs during the sleep periodAge of onsetHow often these episodes occur (frequency) and how long they last for (duration)Description of the episode, including behavior, emotions, and thoughts during and after the eventHow responsive the patient is to external stimuli during the episodeHow conscious or aware the patient is, when awakened from an episodeIf the episode is remembered afterwardsThe triggers or precipitating factorsSleep–wake pattern and sleep environmentDaytime sleepinessOther sleep disorders that might be presentFamily history for NREM parasomnias and other sleep disordersMedical, psychiatric, and neurological historyMedication and substance use historyAdditionally, a home video might be helpful for a proper diagnosis. A polysomnography in the sleep laboratory is recommended for ruling out other disorders, however, sleep terrors occur less frequently in the sleep laboratory than at home and a polysomnography can therefore be unsuccessful at recording the sleep terror episode.[30]Treatment[edit]In most children, night terrors eventually subside and do not need to be treated. It may be helpful to reassure the child and their family that they will outgrow this disorder.[31]The duration of one episode is mostly brief but it may last longer if parents try to wake up the child.[32] Awakening the child may make their agitation stronger.[32] For all these reasons, it is important to let the sleep terror episode fade away and to just be vigilant in order for them not to fall to the ground.[32]Considering an episode could be violent, it may be advisable to secure the environment in which the child sleeps. Windows should be closed and potentially dangerous items should be removed from the bedroom, and additionally, alarms can be installed and the child placed in a downstairs bedroom.[33]Hypnosis could be efficient. Sleepers could become less sensitive to their sleep terrors.[33]One technique is to wake up just before the sleep terrors begin. When they appear regularly, this method can prevent their appearance.[33]Psychotherapy or counseling can be helpful in many cases. There is some evidence to suggest that night terrors can result from lack of sleep or poor sleeping habits. In these cases, it can be helpful to improve the amount and quality of sleep which the child is getting.[31] It is also important to have a good sleep hygiene, if a child has night terrors parents could try to change their sleep hygiene.[32] Another option could be to adapt child\\'s naps so that they are not too long or too short.[32] Then, excessive stress or conflicts in a child\\'s life could also have an impact on their sleep too, so to have some strategies to cope with stress combined with psychotherapy could decrease the frequency of the episodes.[34] A polysomnography can be recommended if the child continues to have a lot of night terror episodes.[32]If all these methods are not enough, benzodiazepines (such as diazepam) or tricyclic antidepressants may be used; however, medication is only recommended in extreme cases.[35] Widening the nasal airway by surgical removal of the adenoid was previously considered and demonstrated to be effective;[26] nowadays, however, invasive treatments are generally avoided.Research[edit]A small study of paroxetine found some benefit.[36] Another small trial found benefit with L -5-hydroxytryptophan (L -5-HTP).[37]See also[edit]Ephialtes (illness)Horror and terrorSleep paralysisReferences[edit]^ .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}Hockenbury, Don H.

       "   'text': 'Rett syndrome is a brain disorder that occurs almost exclusively in girls. The most common form of the condition is known as classic Rett syndrome. After birth, girls with classic Rett syndrome have 6 to 18 months of apparently normal development before developing severe problems with language and communication, learning, coordination, and other brain functions. Early in childhood, affected girls lose purposeful use of their hands and begin making repeated hand wringing, washing, or clapping motions. They tend to grow more slowly than other children and about three-quarters have a small head size (microcephaly). Other signs and symptoms that can develop include breathing abnormalities, spitting or drooling, unusual eye movements such as intense staring or excessive blinking, cold hands and feet, irritability, sleep disturbances, seizures, and an abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis).Researchers have described several variant or atypical forms of Rett syndrome, which can be milder or more severe than the classic form.Rett syndrome is part of a spectrum of disorders with the same genetic cause. Other disorders on the spectrum include PPM-X syndrome, MECP2 duplication syndrome, and MECP2-related severe neonatal encephalopathy. These other conditions can affect males.FrequencyThis condition affects an estimated 1 in 9,000 to 10,000 females.CausesMutations in a gene called MECP2 underlie almost all cases of classic Rett syndrome and some variant forms of the condition. This gene provides instructions for making a protein (MeCP2) that is critical for normal brain function. Although the exact function of the MeCP2 protein is unclear, it is likely involved in maintaining connections (synapses) between nerve cells (neurons). It may also be necessary for the normal function of other types of brain cells.The MeCP2 protein is thought to help regulate the activity of genes in the brain. This protein may also control the production of different versions of certain proteins in brain cells. Mutations in the MECP2 gene alter the MeCP2 protein or result in the production of less protein, which appears to disrupt the normal function of neurons and other cells in the brain. Specifically, studies suggest that changes in the MeCP2 protein may reduce the activity of certain neurons and impair their ability to communicate with one another. It is unclear how these changes lead to the specific features of Rett syndrome.Several conditions with signs and symptoms overlapping those of Rett syndrome have been found to result from mutations in other genes. These conditions, including FOXG1 syndrome and CDKL5 deficiency disorder, were previously thought to be variant forms of Rett syndrome. However, doctors and researchers have identified some important differences between the conditions, so they are now usually considered to be separate disorders.Learn more about the gene associated with Rett syndromeMECP2Inheritance PatternIn more than 99 percent of people with Rett syndrome, there is no history of the disorder in their family. Many of these cases result from new mutations in the MECP2 gene.A few families with more than one affected family member have been described. These cases helped researchers determine that classic Rett syndrome and variants caused by MECP2 gene mutations have an X-linked dominant pattern of inheritance. A condition is considered X-linked if the mutated gene that causes the disorder is located on the X chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes. The inheritance is dominant if one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition.Males with mutations in the MECP2 gene often die in infancy. However, a small number of males with a genetic change involving MECP2 have developed signs and symptoms similar to those of Rett syndrome, including intellectual disability, seizures, and movement problems. In males, this condition is described as MECP2-related severe neonatal encephalopathy. The signs and symptoms in some males with an MECP2 gene mutation are on the milder end of the spectrum.'},\n",

       "   'text': 'A number sign (#) is used with this entry because of evidence that autosomal dominant mental retardation-56 (MRD56) is caused by heterozygous mutation in the CLTC gene (118955) on chromosome 17q23.Clinical FeaturesDeMari et al. (2016) reported a 3.5-year-old girl, conceived through in vitro fertilization, with global developmental delay, intellectual disability, absent language, hypotonia, and inability to walk. Her neonatal period was notable for hypoglycemia, apnea, bradycardia, hyperbilirubinemia, subdural hematoma, laryngomalacia, and feeding difficulties requiring admission to the NICU for a month. She also had hydrocephalus, hypothyroidism, and vitamin K-dependent clotting factor deficiency, and she developed a mediastinal ganglioneuroblastoma. Dysmorphic features included low-set ears, depressed nasal bridge, anteverted nares, and widely spaced and inverted nipples. She did not have seizures; brain imaging and EEG were normal. At age 3.5 years, she was socially alert and interactive and was making some developmental progress.Hamdan et al. (2017) reported 12 unrelated patients with MRD56. The patients ranged in age from 3 to 30 years. All had global developmental delay of varying degree and intellectual disability that ranged from borderline to severe. Most had hypotonia, delayed walking, poor fine motor skills, clumsiness, and poor or absent speech. Several patients were able to attend special schools, whereas a few patients had more significant disability, never achieving ambulation or speech. Several patients had nonspecific and variable dysmorphic features, such as upslanting palpebral fissures, long philtrum, thin upper lip, open mouth, high-arched palate, and prominent ears. Four patients had seizures with onset in the first years of life, and a fifth patient had 1 seizure at age 14 years without recurrence. Two patients had had pharmacoresistant epilepsy with a preponderance of myoclonic and generalized tonic-clonic seizures, whereas 2 had seizures that could be controlled. Other more variable features included ataxia, spasticity, paraparesis, acquired microcephaly, oral and motor apraxia, and behavioral abnormalities, such as impulsivity and attention deficits. Brain imaging was normal in most patients, but showed nonspecific abnormalities in others, including pontocerebellar atrophy, thin corpus callosum, delayed myelination, and abnormal T2-weighed signals.Molecular GeneticsIn a 3.5-year-old girl, conceived by in vitro fertilization, with MRD56, DeMari et al. (2016) identified a de novo heterozygous frameshift mutation in the CLTC gene (118955.0001). The mutation was found by exome sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Functional studies of the variant and studies of patient cells were not performed, but the authors postulated haploinsufficiency of CLTC as the pathogenetic mechanism. DeMari et al. (2016) noted that CLTC is highly expressed in the brain and plays a role in neuronal transmission by facilitating the recycling and/or release of vesicles at the presynaptic termini of neurons.In 12 unrelated patients with MRD56, Hamdan et al. (2017) identified de novo heterozygous missense mutations in the CLTC gene (see, e.g., 118955.0002-118955.0006). The mutations were found by whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing of several cohorts of patients with developmental delay and epilepsy. There were 5 truncating mutations, 2 small in-frame deletions, 1 splice site mutation, and 3 missense mutations, 1 of which was recurrent and found in 3 unrelated patients. Individuals with refractory epilepsy were found to carry variants in the first section of the clathrin light chain-binding domain, whereas truncating mutations affecting the C terminus tended to be associated with hypotonia, global developmental delay, and intellectual disability. Studies of patient cells and functional studies of the variants were not performed. Hamdan et al. (2017) noted that CLTC is involved in endocytosis, intracellular trafficking, and synaptic recycling.INHERITANCE- Autosomal dominantHEAD & NECKHead- Microcephaly, acquiredFace- Dysmorphic features, nonspecific, variable (in some patients)- Long philtrumEars- Prominent earsEyes- Upslanting palpebral fissuresMouth- High-arched palate- Open mouth- Thin upper lip- Oral apraxiaMUSCLE, SOFT TISSUES- HypotoniaNEUROLOGICCentral Nervous System- Global developmental delay- Intellectual disability- Seizures (in some patients)- Ataxia- Spasticity- Paraparesis- Brain abnormalities, nonspecific and variable (in some patients)Behavioral Psychiatric Manifestations- Impulsivity- Attention deficitMISCELLANEOUS- Onset in infancy or first years of life- Highly variable severity- De novo mutationMOLECULAR BASIS- Caused by mutation in the clathrin heavy polypeptide gene (CLTC,118955.0001)▲Close'},\n",

       "   'text': \"Clinical FeaturesRotenstein et al. (1982) described a family in which 4 females in 3 successive generations shared the clinical triad of fever, hypertension, and juvenile polyarthritis, along with the pathologic feature of noncaseating granulomas in vascular and extravascular distribution. The proband was a 5-year-old white girl who at age 8 months developed fever and a persistent macular erythematous rash. At 10 months nodules were noted on her wrists. At 18 months she had fever and symmetrical swelling, warmth and redness of hands, knees, and ankles, and pericardial effusion was noted. At age 4.5 years she had spiking fever, headache, and a seizure, with blood pressure of 200-140 mm Hg, bilateral iritis, papilledema, and pericardial friction rub. Abdominal aortograms showed beading of the splenic, renal and iliac arteries, proximal stenosis and poststenotic dilatation, and intrarenal arterial stenoses. Skin biopsy showed noncaseating granulomatous inflammation. After 1 year of therapy with prednisone and cyclophosphamide, aortograms showed dramatic improvement. In her mother, the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis with features of Still disease was made at age 8 years; in her twenties, she had 5 episodes of unexplained fever. At age 28, she developed fever, jaundice, and elevated alkaline phosphatase; liver biopsy showed noncaseating granulomas. At age 35 she had a pleural effusion. The proband's maternal grandmother, aged 62, had juvenile-onset polyarthritis, unexplained fever only during childhood, recent chronic iritis and noncaseating granulomas on conjunctival biopsy. The proband's maternal aunt, who died at age 24, had rheumatoid arthritis with features of Still disease beginning at age 8 years. Throughout her life, she had recurrent episodes of unexplained fever. In a final hospitalization she had seizures and severe hypertension. Autopsy showed systemic noncaseating granulomas.Di Liberti (1982) suggested that the patients reported by Rotenstein et al. (1982) had the same disorder as that in a family he and his associates presented at the 1974 Birth Defects Conference in Newport Beach, California. Five persons in 2 generations had arthritis beginning in early childhood and initially affecting the hands, wrists and ankles. The dorsal tendon sheaths of the hands and feet were particularly involved. By late childhood the swelling had diminished, but flexion contractures of the fingers and elbows were evident. Periarticular osteoporosis was also present. One child had iritis with prominent synechiae. He died suddenly at play, and at autopsy had granulomatous arteritis of the aorta, coronary arteries, kidneys, liver and other organs. The coronary arteries were almost totally occluded. Although some features suggested childhood sarcoidosis, the conspicuous arteritis is probably a differentiating feature.Malleson et al. (1981) reported a Mexican-American family in which the mother and a daughter and 3 sons had camptodactyly and arthritis. Another son had arthritis but no camptodactyly. One of the affected sons died at age 4.5 years and was shown to have granulomatous arteritis which affected the aorta, pericardium, myocardium, and coronary arteries. He had also had chronic bilateral iridocyclitis. Some of these features suggest Jabs syndrome (186580).INHERITANCE- Autosomal dominantHEAD & NECKEyes- Iritis- PapilledemaCARDIOVASCULARHeart- Pericardial effusionVascular- Granulomatous coronary arteritis- Abdominal aortograms show beading of the splenic, renal and iliac arteries, proximal stenosis and poststenotic dilatation, and intrarenal arterial stenosesRESPIRATORYLung- Pleural effusionSKIN, NAILS, & HAIRSkin- Macular erythematous rash- Subcutaneous nodules- JaundiceNEUROLOGICCentral Nervous System- Headache- SeizuresMETABOLIC FEATURES- FeverENDOCRINE FEATURES- HypertensionIMMUNOLOGY- Juvenile polyarthritis- Rheumatoid arthritis- Noncaseating granulomas, vascular and extravascular, especially hepaticLABORATORY ABNORMALITIES- Elevated alkaline phosphatase▲Close\"},\n",

       "   'text': 'Febrile infection-related epilepsy syndromeOther namesAcute encephalitis with refractory, repetitive partial seizures (AERRPS), new-onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE), devastating epilepsy in school-aged children (DESC).SymptomsPrior febrile illness with or without upper respiratory tract infection and/or gastroenteritis. Convulsive seizures within two weeks of fever.ComplicationsSevere intractable epilepsy, status epilepticusUsual onsetAges 3-15DurationAcute phase lasts 1-12 weeks. Chronic phase is lifelong pharmacoresistent epilepsy and intellectual disability.CausesUnknown, preceded by unspecified febrile illnessPrognosisPoor, 82% of patients experience some level of permanent intellectual disability ranging from mild to vegetative state.Frequency1 in 1,000,000Deaths30% mortality rateFebrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES) is an epilepsy syndrome in which new-onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE) is preceded by febrile illness 24 hours to 2 weeks prior to the onset of seizures. The term was previously used for a paediatric syndrome but was redefined to include all ages.[1]FIRES was previously to refer to this syndrome in children aged three to fifteen years old. A healthy child that may have been ill in the last few days or with a lingering fever goes into a state of continuous seizures. The seizures are resistant to seizure medications and treatments, though barbiturates may be administered.[2]Medical diagnostic tests may initially return no clear diagnosis and may not detect any obvious swelling on the brain. The syndrome is very rare: it may only affect 1 in 1,000,000 children.[3]Contents1 Signs and symptoms2 EEG Findings3 Cause4 Diagnosis5 Treatment6 History7 References8 External linksSigns and symptoms[edit]FIRES starts with a febrile illness up to two weeks before seizure onset. These seizures damage the frontal lobe\\'s cognitive brain function such as memory and sensory abilities. This can result in learning disabilities,[2] behavioral disorders, memory issues, sensory changes, and possibly death. Children continue to have seizures throughout their lives.EEG Findings[edit]EEG findings suggest FIRES is a focal process with focal onset seizures. In a 2011 study of 77 FIRES patients, 58 had focal seizures. Of the 58, 50 had secondarily generalizing seizures (seizures that evolve from focal to generalized).[2][4] On a 10-20 scalp electrode EEG, the ictal activity commonly begins temporally and spreads hemispherically and/or bilaterally.[5] Interictally, patients may have slowing that may be considered an encephalopathic pattern.[6] A recent study of 12 FIRES patients demonstrated diffuse delta-theta background slowing interictally in all 12 cases.[7]Cause[edit]The cause of FIRES is not known.[8] There are some common clinical symptoms, such as onset after a nonspecific febrile illness, gastrointestinal illness, or upper respiratory infection. This prior illness is often cleared 1–14 days prior to the patient\\'s first seizures. There are theories of an immunological source, a genetic predisposition, and an inflammation-mediated process, but the definite cause is unknown. It is more common in boys more than girls.[9][10]Diagnosis[edit]FIRES is difficult to diagnose due to its rarity and lack of definitive biomarker. It is often diagnosed by ruling out other options such as infectious, toxic, metabolic, and genetic causes. FIRES will consist of two phases - acute and chronic. The acute phase consists of highly recurrent focal seizures, rapidly evolving into refractory status epilepticus. The chronic phase consists of drug-resistant epilepsy with cognitive impairment.[citation needed]Treatment[edit]Ketogenic diet is effective in some cases, with efficacy ranging from 16% to over 85%[2][11][12]Vagus nerve stimulation helps control seizure activity after recovery from status.Intravenous immunoglobulin treatment is being explored as an option to treat this form of epilepsy.[13]Barbiturates have been shown to be effective in treating status epilepsy.[14]History[edit]FIRES was named in 2008 by Dr. Andreas van Baalen and colleagues.[15] Previous names include AERRPS (acute encephalitis with refractory, repetitive partial seizures), DESC (Devastating Epilepsy in School-aged Children),[16] and NORSE (New-Onset Refractory Status Epilepticus).[16]References[edit]^ .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}Hirsch, LU; Gaspard, N; van Baalen, A; Nabbout, R; Demeret, S; Loddenkemper, T; Navarro, N; Specchio, N; Lagae, L; Rossetti, A; Hocker, S; Gofton, TE; Abend, NS; Gilmore, EJ; Hahn, C; Khosravani, H; Rosenow, F; Trinka, E (April 2018). \"Proposed consensus definitions for new‐onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE), febrile infection‐related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES), and related conditions\".

       "   'title': 'Spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type 1',\n",
       "   'text': 'Spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type 1 (SMARD1) is an inherited condition that causes muscle weakness and respiratory failure typically beginning in infancy. Early features of this condition are difficult and noisy breathing, especially when inhaling; a weak cry; problems feeding; and recurrent episodes of pneumonia. Typically between the ages of 6 weeks and 6 months, infants with this condition will experience a sudden inability to breathe due to paralysis of the muscle that separates the abdomen from the chest cavity (the diaphragm). Normally, the diaphragm contracts and moves downward during inhalation to allow the lungs to expand. With diaphragm paralysis, affected individuals require life-long support with a machine to help them breathe (mechanical ventilation). Rarely, children with SMARD1 develop signs or symptoms of the disorder later in childhood.Soon after respiratory failure occurs, individuals with SMARD1 develop muscle weakness in their distal muscles. These are the muscles farther from the center of the body, such as muscles in the hands and feet. The weakness soon spreads to all muscles; however, within 2 years, the muscle weakness typically stops getting worse. Some individuals may retain a low level of muscle function, while others lose all ability to move their muscles.Muscle weakness severely impairs motor development, such as sitting, standing, and walking. Some affected children develop an abnormal side-to-side and back-to-front curvature of the spine (scoliosis and kyphosis, often called kyphoscoliosis when they occur together). After approximately the first year of life, individuals with SMARD1 may lose their deep tendon reflexes, such as the reflex being tested when a doctor taps the knee with a hammer.Other features of SMARD1 can include reduced pain sensitivity, excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis), loss of bladder and bowel control, and an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia).FrequencySMARD1 appears to be a rare condition, but its prevalence is unknown. More than 60 cases have been reported in the scientific literature.CausesMutations in the IGHMBP2 gene cause SMARD1. The IGHMBP2 gene provides instructions for making a protein involved in copying (replicating) DNA; producing RNA, a chemical cousin of DNA; and producing proteins. IGHMBP2 gene mutations that cause SMARD1 lead to the production of a protein with reduced ability to aid in DNA replication and the production of RNA and proteins. These problems particularly affect alpha-motor neurons, which are specialized cells in the brainstem and spinal cord that control muscle movements. Although the mechanism is unknown, altered IGHMBP2 proteins contribute to the damage of these neurons and their death over time. The cumulative death of alpha-motor neurons leads to breathing problems and progressive muscle weakness in children with SMARD1.Research suggests that the amount of functional protein that is produced from the mutated IGHMBP2 gene may play a role in the severity of SMARD1. Individuals who have some functional protein are more likely to develop signs and symptoms later in childhood and retain a greater level of muscle function.Learn more about the gene associated with Spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type 1IGHMBP2Inheritance PatternThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.'},\n",

the fever normally presents as a high (above 39–40°C) and remittent, and is followed by extreme irritability.[15][16] Recently, it is reported to be present in patients with atypical or incomplete Kawasaki disease;[17][18] nevertheless, it is not present in 100% of cases.[19]The first day of fever is considered the first day of the illness,[14] and its duration is typically one to two weeks; in the absence of treatment, it may extend for three to four weeks.[3] Prolonged fever is associated with a higher incidence of cardiac involvement.[20] It responds partially to antipyretic drugs and does not cease with the introduction of antibiotics.[3] However, when appropriate therapy is started– intravenous immunoglobulin and aspirin– the fever subsides after two days.[21]Bilateral conjunctival inflammation has been reported to be the most common symptom after fever.[22][23] It typically involves the bulbar conjunctivae, is not accompanied by suppuration, and is not painful.[24] This usually begins shortly after the onset of fever during the acute stage of the disease.[14] Anterior uveitis may be present under slit-lamp examination.[25][26] Iritis can occur, too.[27] Keratic precipitates are another eye manifestation (detectable by a slit lamp, but are usually too small to be seen by the unaided eye).[14][28]Kawasaki disease also presents with a set of mouth symptoms, the most characteristic of which are a red tongue, swollen lips with vertical cracking, and bleeding.[29] The mucosa of the mouth and throat may be bright red, and the tongue may have a typical \"strawberry tongue\" appearance (marked redness with prominent gustative papillae).[3][30] These mouth symptoms are caused by necrotizing microvasculitis with fibrinoid necrosis.[29]Cervical lymphadenopathy is seen in 50% to 75% of children, whereas the other features are estimated to occur in 90%,[14][22] but sometimes it can be the dominant presenting symptom.[28][31] According to the diagnostic criteria, at least one impaired lymph node ≥ 15mm in diameter should be involved.[30] Affected lymph nodes are painless or minimally painful, nonfluctuant, and nonsuppurative; erythema of the neighboring skin may occur.[14] Children with fever and neck adenitis who do not respond to antibiotics should have Kawasaki disease considered as part of the differential diagnoses.[14]Less common manifestationsSystemManifestationsGITDiarrhea, chest pain, abdominal pain, vomiting, liver dysfunction, pancreatitis, hydrops gallbladder,[32] parotitis,[22][33] cholangitis, intussusception, intestinal pseudo-obstruction, ascites, splenic infarctionMSSPolyarthritis and arthralgiaCVSMyocarditis, pericarditis, tachycardia,[30] valvular heart diseaseGUUrethritis, prostatitis, cystitis, priapism, interstitial nephritis, orchitis, nephrotic syndromeCNSLethargy, semicoma,[22] aseptic meningitis, and sensorineural deafnessRSShortness of breath,[30] influenza-like illness, pleural effusion, atelectasisSkinErythema and induration at BCG vaccination site, Beau\\'s lines, and finger gangreneSource: review,[30] table.[34]In the acute phase of the disease, changes in the peripheral extremities can include erythema of the palms and soles, which is often striking with sharp demarcation[14] and often accompanied by painful, brawny edema of the dorsa of the hands or feet, so affected children frequently refuse to hold objects in their hands or to bear weight on their feet.[3][14] Later, during the convalescent or the subacute phase, desquamation of the fingers and toes usually begins in the periungual region within two to three weeks after the onset of fever and may extend to include the palms and soles.[35] Around 11% of children affected by the disease may continue skin-peeling for many years.[36] One to two months after the onset of fever, deep transverse grooves across the nails may develop (Beau\\'s lines),[37] and occasionally nails are shed.[37]The most common skin manifestation is a diffuse macular-papular erythematous rash, which is quite nonspecific.[38] The rash varies over time and is characteristically located on the trunk; it may further spread to involve the face, extremities, and perineum.[3] Many other forms of cutaneous lesions have been reported; they may include scarlatiniform, papular, urticariform, multiform-like erythema, and purpuric lesions; even micropustules were reported.[39][40] It can be polymorphic, not itchy, and normally observed up to the fifth day of fever.[41] However, it is never bullous or vesicular.[3]In the acute stage of Kawasaki disease, systemic inflammatory changes are evident in many organs.[42] Joint pain (arthralgia) and swelling, frequently symmetrical, andarthritis can also occur.[22] Myocarditis,[43] diarrhea,[30] pericarditis, valvulitis, aseptic meningitis, pneumonitis, lymphadenitis, and hepatitis may be present and are manifested by the presence of inflammatory cells in the affected tissues.[42] If left untreated, some symptoms will eventually relent, but coronary artery aneurysms will not improve, resulting in a significant risk of death or disability due to myocardial infarction.[30] If treated quickly, this risk can be mostly avoided and the course of illness cut short.[44]Signs and symptoms and time course of Kawasaki disease[14][45]Other reported nonspecific symptoms include cough, rhinorrhea, sputum, vomiting, headache, and seizure.[22]The course of the disease can be divided into three clinical phases.[46]The acute febrile phase, which usually lasts for one to two weeks, is characterized by fever, conjunctival injection, erythema of the oral mucosa, erythema and swelling of the hands and feet, rash, cervical adenopathy, aseptic meningitis, diarrhea, and hepatic dysfunction.[30] Myocarditis is common during this time, and a pericardial effusion may be present.[14] Coronary arteritis may be present, but aneurysms are generally not yet visible by echocardiography.The subacute phase begins when fever, rash, and lymphadenopathy resolve at about one to two weeks after the onset of fever, but irritability, anorexia, and conjunctival injection persist. Desquamation of the fingers and toes and thrombocytosis are seen during this stage, which generally lasts until about four weeks after the onset of fever. Coronary artery aneurysms usually develop during this time, and the risk for sudden death is highest.[14][47]The convalescent stage begins when all clinical signs of illness have disappeared, and continues until the sedimentation rate returns to normal, usually at six to eight weeks after the onset of illness.[30]Adult onset of Kawasaki disease is rare.[48] The presentation differs between adults and children: in particular, it seems that adults more often have cervical lymphadenopathy, hepatitis, and arthralgia.[30][48]Some children, especially young infants,[49] have atypical presentations without the classic set of symptoms.[46] Such presentations are associated with a higher risk of cardiac artery aneurysms.[14][50]Cardiac[edit]X-ray showing aneurysmal enlargement of the coronary arteries, which is a complication in a Kawasaki syndromeHeart complications are the most important aspect of Kawasaki disease, which is the leading cause of heart disease acquired in childhood in the United States and Japan.[30] In developed nations, it appears to have replaced acute rheumatic fever as the most common cause of acquired heart disease in children.[14] Coronary artery aneurysms occur as a sequela of the vasculitis in 20–25% of untreated children.[51] It is first detected at a mean of 10 days of illness and the peak frequency of coronary artery dilation or aneurysms occurs within four weeks of onset.[47] Aneurysms are classified into small (internal diameter of vessel wall <5mm), medium (diameter ranging from 5–8mm), and giant (diameter > 8mm).[30] Saccular and fusiform aneurysms usually develop between 18 and 25 days after the onset of illness.[14]Even when treated with high-dose IVIG regimens within the first 10 days of illness, 5% of children with Kawasaki disease develop at the least transient coronary artery dilation and 1% develop giant aneurysms.[52][53][54] Death can occur either due to myocardial infarction secondary to blood clot formation in a coronary artery aneurysm or to rupture of a large coronary artery aneurysm. Death is most common two to 12 weeks after the onset of illness.[14]Many risk factors predicting coronary artery aneurysms have been identified,[20] including persistent fever after IVIG therapy,[55][56] low hemoglobin concentrations, low albumin concentrations, high white-blood-cell count, high band count, high CRP concentrations, male sex, and age less than one year.[57]Coronary artery lesions resulting from Kawasaki disease change dynamically with time.[3] Resolution one to two years after the onset of the disease has been observed in half of vessels with coronary aneurysms.[58][59] Narrowing of the coronary artery, which occurs as a result of the healing process of the vessel wall, often leads to significant obstruction of the blood vessel andthe heart not receiving enough blood and oxygen.[58] This can eventually lead to heart muscle tissue death, i.e., myocardial infarction (MI).[58]MI caused by thrombotic occlusion in an aneurysmal, stenotic, or both aneurysmal and stenotic coronary artery is the main cause of death from Kawasaki disease.[60] The highest risk of MI occurs in the first year after the onset of the disease.[60] MI in children presents with different symptoms from those in adults. The main symptoms were shock, unrest, vomiting, and abdominal pain; chest pain was most common in older children.[60] Most of these children had the attack occurring during sleep or at rest, and around one-third of attacks were asymptomatic.[14]Valvular insufficiencies, particularly of mitral or tricuspid valves, are often observed in the acute phase of Kawasaki disease due to inflammation of the heart valve or inflammation of the heart muscle-induced myocardial dysfunction, regardless of coronary involvement.[58] These lesions mostly disappear with the resolution of acute illness,[61] but a very small group of the lesions persist and progress.[62] There is also late-onset aortic or mitral insufficiency caused by thickening or deformation of fibrosed valves, with the timing ranging from several months to years after the onset of Kawasaki disease.[63] Some of these lesions require valve replacement.[64]Other[edit]Other Kawasaki disease complications have been described, such as aneurysm of other arteries: aortic aneurysm,[65] with a higher number of reported cases involving the abdominal aorta,[66][67] axillary artery aneurysm,[68] brachiocephalic artery aneurysm,[69] aneurysm of iliac and femoral arteries, and renal artery aneurysm.[3][70] Other vascular complications can occur such as increased wall thickness and decreased distensibility of carotid arteries,[71] aorta,[72] and brachioradial artery.[73] This change in the vascular tone is secondary to endothelial dysfunction.[70] In addition, children with Kawasaki disease, with or without coronary artery complications, may have a more adverse cardiovascular risk profile,[73] such as high blood pressure, obesity, and abnormal serum lipid profile.[74]Gastrointestinal complications in Kawasaki disease are similar to those observed in Henoch–Schönlein purpura,[68] such as: intestinal obstruction,[75] colon swelling,[76] intestinal ischemia,[77] intestinal pseudo-obstruction,[78] and acute abdomen.[79]Eye changes associated with the disease have been described since the 1980s, being found as uveitis, iridocyclitis, conjunctival hemorrhage,[80][81][82] optic neuritis,[68] amaurosis, and ocular artery obstruction.[83] It can also be found as necrotizing vasculitis, progressing into peripheral gangrene.[84]The neurological complications per central nervous systemlesions are increasingly reported.[85] The neurological complications found are meningoencephalitis,[86] subdural effusion,[87][88] cerebral hypoperfusion,[89] cerebral ischemia and infarct,[90] cerebellar infarction,[91] manifesting with seizures, chorea, hemiplegia, mental confusion, lethargy and coma,[68] or even a cerebral infarction with no neurological manifestations.[90] Other neurological complications from cranial nerve involvement are reported as ataxia,[68] facial palsy,[92] and sensorineural hearing loss.[93][94] Behavioral changes are thought to be caused by localised cerebral hypoperfusion,[89] can include attention deficits, learning deficits, emotional disorders (emotional lability, fear of night, and night terrors), and internalization problems (anxious, depressive or aggressive behavior).[95][96]Causes[edit]The specific cause of Kawasaki disease is unknown.[97][98][99][100] A plausible explanation is that it may be caused by an infection that triggers an inappropriate immunologic cascade in a small number of genetically predisposed children.[6][101] The pathogenesis is complex and incompletely understood.[102] Various explanations exist.[100] (See #Classification)Circumstantial evidence points to an infectious cause.[103] Since recurrences are unusual in Kawasaki disease, it is thought that the trigger is more likely to be represented by a single pathogen, rather than a range of viral or bacterial agents.[104] Various candidates have been implicated, including upper respiratory tract infection by some novel RNA virus.[6]Despite intensive search, no single pathogen has been identified.[102] There has been debate as to whether the infectious agent might be a superantigen (i.e. one commonly associated with excessive immune system activation).[105][100] Current consensus favors an excessive immunologic response to a conventional antigen which usually provides future protection.[6] Research points to an unidentified ubiquitous virus,[106] possibly one that enters through the respiratory tract.[107]Seasonal trends in the appearance of new cases of Kawasaki disease have been linked to tropospheric wind patterns, which suggests wind-borne transport of something capable of triggering an immunologic cascade when inhaled by genetically susceptible children.[6] Winds blowing from central Asia correlate with numbers of new cases of Kawasaki disease in Japan, Hawaii, and San Diego.[108] These associations are themselves modulated by seasonal and interannual events in the El Niño–Southern Oscillation in winds and sea surface temperatures over the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean.[109] Efforts have been made to identify a possible pathogen in air-filters flown at altitude above Japan.[110] One source has been suggested in northeastern China.[6][111]Genetics[edit]Genetic susceptibility is suggested by increased incidence among children of Japanese descent around the world, and also among close and extended family members of affected people.[6]Genetic factors are also thought to influence development of coronary artery aneurysms and response to treatment.[112]The exact genetic contribution remains unknown.[113] Genome-wide association studies and studies of individual candidate genes have together helped identify specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), mostly found in genes with immune regulatory functions.[112] The associated genes and their levels of expression appear to vary among different ethnic groups, both with Asian and non-Asian backgrounds.[114]SNPs in FCGR2A, CASP3, BLK, ITPKC, CD40 and ORAI1 have all been linked to susceptibility, prognosis, and risk of developing coronary artery aneurysms.[114] Various other possible susceptibility genes have been proposed, including polymorphisms in the HLA region, but their significance is disputed.[113] Genetic susceptibility to Kawasaki disease appears complex.[115] Gene–gene interactions also seem to affect susceptibility and prognosis.[114] At an epigenetic level, altered DNA methylation has been proposed as an early mechanistic factor during the acute phase of the disease.[114]Diagnosis[edit]Criteria for diagnosisFever of ≥5 days\\' duration associated with at least four† of these five changesBilateral nonsuppurative conjunctivitisOne or more changes of the mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract, including throat redness, dry cracked lips, red lips, and \"strawberry\" tongueOne or more changes of the arms and legs, including redness, swelling, skin peeling around the nails, and generalized peelingPolymorphous rash, primarily truncalLarge lymph nodes in the neck (>15mm in size)Disease cannot be explained by some other known disease process†A diagnosis of Kawasaki disease can be made if fever and only three changes are present if coronary artery disease is documented by two-dimensional echocardiography or coronary angiography.Source: Nelson\\'s essentials of pediatrics,[116] Review[117]Angiography showing ectatic LAD, with largest aneurysm = 6.5 mm in diameterSince no specific laboratory test exists for Kawasaki disease, diagnosis must be based on clinical signs and symptoms, together with laboratory findings.[8] Timely diagnosis requires careful history-taking and thorough physical examination.[118] Establishing the diagnosis is difficult, especially early in the course of the illness, and frequently children are not diagnosed until they have seen several health-care providers. Many other serious illnesses can cause similar symptoms, and must be considered in the differential diagnosis, including scarlet fever, toxic shock syndrome, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and childhood mercury poisoning (infantile acrodynia).[119]Classically, five days of fever[120] plus four of five diagnostic criteria must be met to establish the diagnosis. The criteria are:[121]erythema of the lips or oral cavity or cracking of the lipsrash on the trunkswelling or erythema of the hands or feetred eyes (conjunctival injection)swollen lymph node in the neck of at least 15mmMany children, especially infants, eventually diagnosed with Kawasaki disease, do not exhibit all of the above criteria. In fact, many experts now recommend treating for Kawasaki disease even if only three days of fever have passed and at least three diagnostic criteria are present, especially if other tests reveal abnormalities consistent with Kawasaki disease. In addition, the diagnosis can be made purely by the detection of coronary artery aneurysms in the proper clinical setting.[citation needed]Investigations[edit]A physical examination will demonstrate many of the features listed above.Blood testsComplete blood count may reveal normocytic anemia and eventually thrombocytosis.Erythrocyte sedimentation rate will be elevated.C-reactive protein will be elevated.Liver function tests may show evidence of hepatic inflammation and low serum albumin levels.[122]Other optional tests include:Electrocardiogram may show evidence of ventricular dysfunction or, occasionally, arrhythmia due to myocarditis.Echocardiogram may show subtle coronary artery changes or, later, true aneurysms.Ultrasound or computerized tomography may show hydrops (enlargement) of the gallbladder.Urinalysis may show white blood cells and protein in the urine (pyuria and proteinuria) without evidence of bacterial growth.Lumbar puncture may show evidence of aseptic meningitis.Angiography was historically used to detect coronary artery aneurysms, and remains the gold standard for their detection, but is rarely used today unless coronary artery aneurysms have already been detected by echocardiography.Biopsy is rarely performed, as it is not necessary for diagnosis.[7]Subtypes[edit]Based on clinical findings, a diagnostic distinction may be made between the \\'classic\\' / \\'typical\\' presentation of Kawasaki disease and \\'incomplete\\' / \\'atypical\\' presentation of a \"suspected\" form of the disease.[6] Regarding \\'incomplete\\' / \\'atypical\\' presentation, American Heart Association guidelines state that Kawasaki disease \"should be considered in the differential diagnosis of prolonged unexplained fever in childhood associated with any of the principal clinical features of the disease, and the diagnosis can be considered confirmed when coronary artery aneurysms are identified in such patients by echocardiography.\"[6]A further distinction between \\'incomplete\\' and \\'atypical\\' subtypes may also be made in the presence of non-typical symptoms.[46]Case definition[edit]For study purposes, including vaccine safety monitoring, an international case definition has been proposed to categorize \\'definite\\' (i.e. complete/incomplete), \\'probable\\' and \\'possible\\' cases of Kawasaki disease.[123]Differential diagnosis[edit]The broadness of the differential diagnosis is a challenge to timely diagnosis of Kawasaki disease.[8] Infectious and noninfectious conditions requiring consideration include: measles and other viral infections (e.g. adenovirus, enterovirus); staphylococcal and streptococcal toxin-mediated diseases such as scarlet fever and toxic shock syndrome; drug hypersensitivity reactions (including Stevens Johnson syndrome); systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis; Rocky Mountain spotted fever or other rickettsial infections; and leptospirosis.[6] Infectious conditions that can mimic Kawasaki disease include periorbital cellulitis, peritonsillar abscess, retropharyngeal abscess, cervical lymphadenitis, parvovirus B19, mononucleosis, rheumatic fever, meningitis, staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and Lyme disease.[7]Kawasaki-like disease temporally associated with COVID-19[edit]In 2020, reports of a Kawasaki-like disease following exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, emerged in the US and Europe.[9] The World Health Organization is examining possible links with COVID-19.[124] This emerging condition was named \\'paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome\\' by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health,[4] and \\'multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children\\' by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.[125] Guidance for diagnosis and reporting of cases has been issued by these organizations.[4][124][125]Classification[edit]Debate has occurred about whether Kawasaki disease should be viewed as a characteristic immune response to some infectiouspathogen, as an autoimmune process, or as an autoinflammatory disease (i.e. involving innate rather than adaptive immune pathways).[100] Overall, immunological research suggests that Kawasaki disease is associated with a response to a conventional antigen (rather than a superantigen) that involves both activation of the innate immune system and also features of an adaptive immune response.[6][126] Identification of the exact nature of the immune process involved in Kawasaki disease could help guide research aimed at improving clinical management.[100]Inflammation, or vasculitis, of the arteries and veins occurs throughout the body, usually caused by increased production of the cells of the immune system to a pathogen, or autoimmunity.[127] Systemic vasculitides may be classified according to the type of cells involved in the proliferation, as well as the specific type of tissue damage occurring within the vein or arterial walls.[127] Under this classification scheme for systemic vasculitis, Kawasaki disease is considered to be a necrotizing vasculitis (also called necrotizing angiitis), which may be identified histologically by the occurrence of necrosis (tissue death), fibrosis, and proliferation of cells associated with inflammation in the inner layer of the vascular wall.[127][128]Other diseases involving necrotizing vasculitis include polyarteritis nodosa, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, Henoch–Schönlein purpura, and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis.[127]Kawasaki disease may be further classified as a medium-sized vessel vasculitis, affecting medium- and small-sized blood vessels,[42][129][130] such as the smaller cutaneous vasculature (veins and arteries in the skin) that range from 50 to 100µm in diameter.[30][131] Kawasaki disease is also considered to be a primary childhood vasculitis, a disorder associated with vasculitis that mainly affects children under the age of 18.[117][132] A recent, consensus-based evaluation of vasculitides occurring primarily in children resulted in a classification scheme for these disorders, to distinguish them and suggest a more concrete set of diagnostic criteria for each.[117] Within this classification of childhood vasculitides, Kawasaki disease is, again, a predominantly medium-sized vessel vasculitis.[117]It can also be classed as an autoimmune form of vasculitis.[3] It is not associated with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, unlike other vasculitic disorders associated with them (such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis, and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis).[127][133] This form of categorization is relevant for appropriate treatment.[134]Treatment[edit]Children with Kawasaki disease should be hospitalized and cared for by a physician who has experience with this disease. In an academic medical center, care is often shared between pediatric cardiology, pediatric rheumatology, and pediatric infectious disease specialists (although no specific infectious agent has yet been identified).[135] To prevent damage to coronary arteries, treatment should be started immediately following the diagnosis.[citation needed]Intravenous immunoglobulin(IVIG) is the standard treatment for Kawasaki disease[136] and is administered in high doses with marked improvement usually noted within 24 hours. If the fever does not respond, an additional dose may be considered. In rare cases, a third dose may be given. IVIG by is most useful within the first seven days of fever onset, to prevent coronary artery aneurysm. IVIG given within the first 10 days of the disease reduces the risk of damage to the coronary arteries in children, without serious adverse effects.[136]Salicylate therapy, particularly aspirin, remains an important part of the treatment (though questioned by some)[137] but salicylates alone are not as effective as IVIG. There is limited evidence to indicate whether children should continue to receive salicylate as part of their treatment.[138] Aspirin therapy is started at high doses until the fever subsides, and then is continued at a low dose when the patient returns home, usually for two months to prevent blood clots from forming. Except for Kawasaki disease and a few other indications, aspirin is otherwise normally not recommended for children due to its association with Reye syndrome. Because children with Kawasaki disease will be taking aspirin for up to several months, vaccination against varicella and influenza is required, as these infections are most likely to cause Reye syndrome.[139]High-dose aspirin is associated with anemia and does not confer benefit to disease outcomes.[140]About 15-20% of children following the initial IVIG infusion show persistent or recurrent fever and are classified as IVIG-resistant. While the use of TNF alpha blockers (TNF-α) may reduce treatment resistance and the infusion reaction after treatment initiation, further research is needed.[141]Corticosteroids have also been used,[142]especially when other treatments fail or symptoms recur, but in a randomized controlled trial, the addition of corticosteroid to immune globulin and aspirin did not improve outcome.[143] Additionally, corticosteroid use in the setting of Kawasaki disease is associated with increased risk of coronary artery aneurysm, so its use is generally contraindicated in this setting.In cases of Kawasaki disease refractory to IVIG, cyclophosphamide and plasma exchange have been investigated as possible treatments, with variable outcomes. However, a Cochrane review published in 2017 found that, in children, the use of corticosteroids in the acute phase of KD was associated with improved coronary artery abnormalities, shorter hospital stays, a decreased duration of clinical symptoms, and reduced inflammatory marker levels. Patient populations based in Asia, people with higher risk scores, and those receiving longer steroid treatment may have greater benefit from steroid use.[144]Prognosis[edit]With early treatment, rapid recovery from the acute symptoms can be expected, and the risk of coronary artery aneurysms is greatly reduced. Untreated, the acute symptoms of Kawasaki disease are self-limited (i.e. the patient will recover eventually), but the risk of coronary artery involvement is much greater, even many years later. Many cases of myocardial infarction in young adults have now been attributed to Kawasaki disease that went undiagnosed during childhood.[6] Overall, about 2% of patients die from complications of coronary vasculitis.[citation needed]Laboratory evidence of increased inflammation combined with demographic features (male sex, age less than six months or greater than eight years) and incomplete response to IVIG therapy create a profile of a high-risk patient with Kawasaki disease.[57][145] The likelihood that an aneurysm will resolve appears to be determined in large measure by its initial size, in which the smaller aneurysms have a greater likelihood of regression.[146][147] Other factors are positively associated with the regression of aneurysms, including being younger than a year old at the onset of Kawasaki disease, fusiform rather than saccular aneurysm morphology, and an aneurysm location in a distal coronary segment.[59] The highest rate of progression to stenosis occurs among those who develop large aneurysms.[3] The worst prognosis occurs in children with giant aneurysms.[148] This severe outcome may require further treatment such as percutaneous transluminal angioplasty,[149] coronary artery stenting,[150] bypass grafting,[151] and even cardiac transplantation.[152]A relapse of symptoms may occur soon after initial treatment with IVIG. This usually requires rehospitalization and retreatment. Treatment with IVIG can cause allergic and nonallergic acute reactions, aseptic meningitis, fluid overload, and rarely, other serious reactions. Overall, life-threatening complications resulting from therapy for Kawasaki disease are exceedingly rare, especially compared with the risk of nontreatment. Evidence indicates Kawasaki disease produces altered lipid metabolism that persists beyond the clinical resolution of the disease.[citation needed]Rarely, recurrence can occur in Kawasaki disease with or without treatment.[153][154]Epidemiology[edit]Kawasaki disease affects boys more than girls, with people of Asian ethnicity, particularly Japanese people. The higher incidence in Asian populations is thought to be linked to genetic susceptibility.[155] Incidence rates vary between countries.Currently, Kawasaki disease is the most commonly diagnosed pediatric vasculitis in the world.By far, the highest incidence of Kawasaki disease occurs in Japan, with the most recent study placing the attack rate at 218.6 per 100,000 children less than five years of age (about one in 450 children).At this present attack rate, more than one in 150 children in Japan will develop Kawasaki disease during their lifetimes.[citation needed]However, its incidence in the United States is increasing. Kawasaki disease is predominantly a disease of young children, with 80% of patients younger than five years of age. About 2,000–4,000 cases are identified in the U.S. each year (9 to 19 per 100,000 children younger than five years of age).[135][156][157] In the continental United States, Kawasaki disease is more common during the winter and early spring, boys with the disease outnumber girls by ≈1.5–1.7:1, and 76% of affected children are less than years of age.[158]In the United Kingdom, prior to 2000, it was diagnosed in fewer than one in every 25,000 people per year.[159] Incidence of the disease doubled from 1991 to 2000, however, with four cases per 100,000 children in 1991 compared with a rise of eight cases per 100,000 in 2000.[160] By 2017, this figure had risen to 12 in 100,000 people with 419 diagnosed cases of Kawasaki disease in the United Kingdom.[161]In Japan, the rate is 240 in every 100,000 people.[162]Coronary artery aneurysms due to Kawasaki disease are believed to account for 5% of acute coronary syndrome cases in adults under 40 years of age.[6]History[edit]The disease was first reported by Tomisaku Kawasaki in a four-year-old child with a rash and fever at the Red Cross Hospital in Tokyo in January 1961, and he later published a report on 50 similar cases.[163] Later, Kawasaki and colleagues were persuaded of definite cardiac involvement when they studied and reported 23 cases, of which 11 (48%) patients had abnormalities detected by an electrocardiogram.[164] In 1974, the first description of this disorder was published in the English-language literature.[165] In 1976, Melish et al. described the same illness in 16 children in Hawaii.[166] Melish and Kawasaki had independently developed the same diagnostic criteria for the disorder, which are still used today to make the diagnosis of classic Kawasaki disease. Dr. Kawasaki died on June 5, 2020 at the age of 95.[167]A question was raised whether the disease only started during the period between 1960 and 1970, but later a preserved heart of a seven-year-old boy who died in 1870 was examined and showed three aneurysms of the coronary arteries with clots, as well as pathologic changes consistent with Kawasaki disease.[168] Kawasaki disease is now recognized worldwide. Why cases began to emerge across all continents around the 1960s and 1970s is unclear.[169] Possible explanations could include confusion with other diseases such as scarlet fever, and easier recognition stemming from modern healthcare factors such as the widespread use of antibiotics.[169] In particular, old pathological descriptions from Western countries of infantile polyarteritis nodosa coincide with reports of fatal cases of Kawasaki disease.[6]In the United States and other developed nations, Kawasaki disease appears to have replaced acute rheumatic fever as the most common cause of acquired heart disease in children.[170]References[edit]^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}\"Kawasaki Disease\".

In general, the child\\'s temperature is greater than 38°C (100.4°F),[4] although most have a fever of 39°C (102.2°F) or higher.[6] Most febrile seizures will occur during the first 24 hours of developing a fever.[6] Signs of typical seizure activity include loss of consciousness, opened eyes which may be deviated or appear to be looking towards one direction, irregular breathing, increased secretions or foaming at the mouth, and the child may look pale or blue (cyanotic).[4][6] They may become incontinent (wet or soil themselves) and may also vomit.[4]Types[edit]There are two types of febrile seizures: simple and complex.[5] Febrile status epilepticus is a subtype of complex febrile seizures that lasts for longer than 30 minutes.[7] It can occur in up to 5% of febrile seizure cases.[13] Types[6][14][7]SimpleComplexCharacteristicsGeneralized tonic clonic movements (stiffening and shaking of arms and legs)Focal movements (usually affecting a single limb or side of the body)Duration<15 minutes (with most lasting <5 minutes)>15 minutesPostictal stateNone or short period of drowsinessLonger period of drowsiness;

and performing a physical exam that looks for signs of infection including meningitis and neurological status.[6] Blood tests, imaging of the brain and an electroencephalogram are generally not needed.[1][14] However, for complex febrile seizures, EEG and imaging with an MRI of the brain may be helpful.[20][23]Lumbar puncture is recommended if there are obvious signs and symptoms of meningitis or if there is high clinical suspicion.[14] However, lumbar puncture is an option that may be considered in children younger than 12 months of age since signs and symptoms of meningitis may be atypical, if the child does not return to baseline, or if the child lacks immunization against Haemophilus influenzae and pneumococcal or vaccination status is unknown.[14][5][6]Differential diagnosis includes other causes of seizures such as CNS infections (i.e. meningitis, encephalitis), metabolic disturbances (i.e. electrolyte imbalances), CNS trauma, drug use and/or withdrawal, genetic conditions (i.e. GEFS+), FIRES, shivering, febrile delirium, febrile myoclonus, breath holding spells, and convulsive syncope.[6] However, febrile seizures are still the most likely cause of convulsions in children under the age of 5 years old.[14]Prevention[edit]There is no benefit from the use of phenytoin, valproate, pyridoxine, ibuprofen, zinc sulfate, diclofenac, or acetaminophen.[9] There is no evidence to support administering fever reducing medications such as acetaminophen at the time of a febrile seizure or to prevent the rate of recurrence.[24] Rapid cooling methods such as an ice bath or a cold bath should be avoided as a method to lower the child\\'s temperature, especially during a febrile seizure.[11]There is a decrease of recurrent febrile seizures with intermittent diazepam and phenobarbital but there is a high rate of adverse effects.[9] They are thus not recommended as an effort to prevent further seizures.[1]Treatment[edit]Side positioning for person having a seizureIf a child is having a febrile seizure, the following recommendations are made for caregivers:[25]Note the start time of the seizure. If the seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes, call an ambulance. Medication to stop seizure, such as rectal diazepam or intranasal midazolam may be used.[3] The child should be taken immediately to the nearest medical facility for further diagnosis and treatment.[25]Gradually place the child on a protected surface such as the floor or ground to prevent accidental injury.Do not restrain or hold a child during a convulsion.[25]Position the child on his or her side or stomach to prevent choking.When possible, gently remove any objects from the child\\'s mouth. Nothing should ever be placed in the child\\'s mouth during a convulsion.These objects can obstruct the child\\'s airway and make breathing difficult.[25]Seek immediate medical attention if this is the child\\'s first febrile seizure and take the child to the doctor once the seizure has ended to check for the cause of the fever.This is especially urgent if the child shows symptoms of stiff neck, extreme lethargy, or abundant vomiting, which may be signs of meningitis, an infection over the brain surface.[25]In those with a single seizure lasting greater than 5 minutes or two consecutive seizures lasting greater than 5 minutes in which the person has not returned to their baseline mental status, defined as status epilepticus, intravenous lorazepam, rectal diazepam, or intranasal midazolam is recommended.[1][3] Anti-seizure medication are used in status epilepticus in an effort to prevent complications such as injury to the hippocampus or temporal lobe epilepsy.[26]Secondary causes of a seizure should be addressed if present. Questions that may be asked of the caregivers who witnessed the seizure include, length of seizure, timing of day, loss of consciousness, loss of bowel or urinary continence, a period of altered level of consciousness of confusion once the seizure stopped, movement of the eyes to a specific side, recent infections, recent medication usage including antibiotics or fever reducer medications, family history of febrile and afebrile seizures, vaccination and travel history.[citation needed]Vital signs should be monitored in the emergency department along with observation for 6 hours. Evaluation for the cause of fever should be performed including signs of an infection such as a bulging tympanic membrane (otitis media), red pharynx, enlarged tonsils, enlarged cervical lymph nodes (streptococcal pharyngitis or infectious mononucleosis), and a widespread rash.[6] CNS infections such as meningitis, encephalitis and brain abscesses should be ruled out, along with electrolyte abnormalities.[citation needed]Prognosis[edit]Long term outcomes are generally good with little risk of neurological problems or epilepsy.[1] Those who have one febrile seizure have an approximately 30- 40% chance of having another one in the next two years, with the risk being greater in those who are younger.[1][6]Simple febrile seizures do not tend to recur frequently (children tend to outgrow them) and do not make the development of adult epilepsy significantly more likely (about 3–5%) compared with the general public (1%).[27] Children with febrile convulsions are more likely to have a febrile seizure in the future if they were young at their first seizure (less than 18 months old), have a family history of a febrile convulsions in first-degree relatives (a parent or sibling), have a short time between the onset of fever and the seizure, had a low degree of fever before their seizure, or have a seizure history of abnormal neurological signs or developmental delay. Similarly, the prognosis after a complex febrile seizure is excellent, although an increased risk of death has been shown for complex febrile seizures, partly related to underlying conditions.[28]Epidemiology[edit]Febrile seizures happen between the ages of 6 months and 5 years.[1][3][29] The peak age for a febrile seizure is 18 months, with the most common age range being 12–30 months of age.[30] They affect between 2-5% of children.[1][3][29] They are more common in boys than girls.[12][6] Febrile seizures can occur in any ethnic group, although there have been higher rates in Guamanians (14%), Japanese (6-9%) and Indians (5-10%).[31]References[edit]^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z aa ab ac ad ae af ag ah ai aj .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}Graves RC, Oehler K, Tingle LE (January 2012). \"Febrile seizures: risks, evaluation, and prognosis\".

Although most cases occurs before six years of age, first episodes have been observed in teenagers and adults. ANE begins within 12 hours to three or four days of the first viral symptoms. Symptoms include fever, cough, congestion, vomiting, and diarrhea in the first few days, followed by neurological problems, such as seizures, hallucinations, difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia), or abnormal muscle tone. Most affected individuals go into a coma, which usually lasts for a number of weeks. The condition is described as \"acute\" because the episodes of illness are time-limited. It is caused by mutations in the RANBP2 gene. Inheritance is autosomal dominant. In many cases, treatment involves corticosteroids, as well as immunoglobulin therapy, plasmapheresis, and TNFα antagonists. In some cases, treatment is not required.'},\n",

The child may cling to something or someone for support. The episode lasts only minutes and resolves suddenly and completely. It is a self-limiting condition and usually resolves after about eighteen months, although many go on to experience migrainous vertigo (or vestibular migraine) when older.[citation needed]Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood is a migrainous phenomenon with more than 50% of those affected having a family history of migraines affecting a first-degree relative.

Vomiting after a coughing spell or an inspiratory whooping sound on coughing, almost doubles the likelihood that the illness is pertussis. The absence of a paroxysmal cough or posttussive emesis, though, makes it almost half as likely.[18]The illness usually starts with mild respiratory symptoms include mild coughing, sneezing, or a runny nose (known as the catarrhal stage). After one to two weeks, the coughing classically develops into uncontrollable fits, sometimes followed by a high-pitched \"whoop\" sound, as the person tries to inhale. About 50% of children and adults \"whoop\" at some point in diagnosed pertussis cases during the paroxysmal stage.This stage usually lasts two to eight weeks, or sometimes longer. A gradual transition then occurs to the convalescent stage, which usually lasts one to four weeks. This stage is marked by a decrease in paroxysms of coughing, although paroxysms may occur with subsequent respiratory infection for many months after the onset of pertussis.[19]Symptoms of pertussis can be variable, especially between immunized and non-immunized people. Those that are immunized can present with a more mild infection; they may only have the paroxysmal cough for a couple of weeks, and it may lack the \"whooping\" characteristic.[20] Although immunized people have a milder form of the infection, they can spread the disease to others who are not immune.[20]Incubation period[edit]The time between exposure and the development of symptoms is on average 7–14 days (range 6–20 days),[21] rarely as long as 42 days.[22]Cause[edit]Pertussis is caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis. It is an airborne disease (through droplets) that spreads easily through the coughs and sneezes of an infected person.[4]Spread from other animals[edit]Uncertainties have existed of B. pertussis and whooping cough as a zoonotic disease since around 1910[23][24] but in the 1930s, knowledge was gained that the bacteria lost their virulent power when repeatedly spread on agar media. This explained the difficulties to reproduce results from different studies as the pre-inoculating handlings of the bacteria were not standardized among scientists.[25]Today it is established that at least some primate species are highly susceptible to B. pertussis and develop clinical whooping cough in high incidence when exposed to low inoculation doses.[26][27] The bacteria may be present in wild animal populations, but this is not confirmed by laboratory diagnosis, although whooping cough is known among wild gorillas.[28] Several zoos also have a long-standing custom of vaccinating their primates against whooping cough.[29]Mechanism[edit]After the bacteria are inhaled, they initially adhere to the ciliated epithelium in the nasopharynx. Surface proteins of B. pertussis, including filamentous hemaglutinin and pertactin, mediate attachment to the epithelium. The bacteria then multiply.[30][31] In infants, who experience more severe disease, the bacteria spread down to the lungs.[31]The bacteria secretes a number of toxins. Tracheal cytotoxin, a fragment of peptidoglycan, kills ciliated epithelial cells and thereby inhibits the mucociliary elevator by which mucus and debris are removed.[32] TCT may contribute to the cough characteristic of pertussis.[33] The cough may also be caused by a yet-to-be identified \"cough toxin\".[34] Pertussis toxin causes lymphocytosis by an unknown mechanism. The elevated number of white blood cells leads to pulmonary hypertension, a major cause of death by pertussis.[32][31] In infants who develop encephalopathy, cerebral hemorrhage and cortical atrophy occur, likely due to hypoxia.[31]Diagnosis[edit]Gram stain of Bordetella pertussisBased on symptoms[edit]A physician\\'s overall impression is most effective in initially making the diagnosis.[35] Single factors are much less useful.[35] In adults with a cough of less than 8 weeks, vomiting after coughing or a \"whoop\" is supportive.[36] If there are no bouts of coughing or there is a fever the diagnosis is unlikely.[36] In children who have a cough of less than 4 weeks vomiting after coughing is somewhat supportive but not definitive.[36]Lab tests[edit]Methods used in laboratory diagnosis include culturing of nasopharyngeal swabs on a nutrient medium (Bordet-Gengou medium), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), direct fluorescent antibody (DFA), and serological methods (e.g. complement fixation test).[37] The bacteria can be recovered from the person only during the first three weeks of illness, rendering culturing and DFA useless after this period, although PCR may have some limited usefulness for an additional three weeks.Serology may be used for adults and adolescents who have already been infected for several weeks to determine whether antibody against pertussis toxin or another virulence factor of B. pertussis is present at high levels in the blood of the person.[38]Differential diagnosis[edit]A similar, milder disease is caused by B. parapertussis.[39]Prevention[edit]The primary method of prevention for pertussis is vaccination.[40] Evidence is insufficient to determine the effectiveness of antibiotics in those who have been exposed, but are without symptoms.[41] Preventive antibiotics, however, are still frequently used in those who have been exposed and are at high risk of severe disease (such as infants).[6]Vaccine[edit]Pertussis vaccines are effective at preventing illness[42] and are recommended for routine use by the World Health Organization[43] and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.[44] The vaccine saved an estimated half a million lives in 2002.[43]The multicomponent acellular pertussis vaccine is 71–85% effective, with greater effectiveness against more severe strains.[42] However, despite widespread vaccination, pertussis has persisted in vaccinated populations and is today \"one of the most common vaccine-preventable diseases in Western countries\".[45] The 21st-century resurgences in pertussis infections is attributed to a combination of waning immunity and bacterial mutations that elude vaccines.[45][46]Immunization does not confer lifelong immunity; a 2011 CDC study indicated that protection may only last three to six years. This covers childhood, which is the time of greatest exposure and greatest risk of death from pertussis.[18][47]An effect of widespread immunization on society has been the shift of reported infections from children aged 1–9 years to infants, adolescents, and adults, with adolescents and adults acting as reservoirs for B. pertussis and infecting infants who have had fewer than three doses of vaccine.[48]Infection induces incomplete natural immunity that wanes over time.[49] A 2005 study said estimates of the duration of infection-acquired immunity range from 7 to 20 years and the different results could be the result of differences in levels of circulating B. pertussis, surveillance systems, and case definitions used. The study said protective immunity after vaccination wanes after 4–12 years.[50] One study suggested that the availability of vaccine exemptions increases the number of pertussis cases.[51]Some studies have suggested that while acellular pertussis vaccines are effective at preventing the disease, they have a limited impact on infection and transmission, meaning that vaccinated people could spread pertussis even though they may have only mild symptoms or none at all.[52][53] Pertussis infection in these persons may be asymptomatic, or present as illness ranging from a mild cough to classic pertussis with persistent cough (i.e., lasting more than 7 days). Even though the disease may be milder in older persons, those who are infected may transmit the disease to other susceptible persons, including unimmunized or incompletely immunized infants. Older persons are often found to have the first case in a household with multiple pertussis cases, and are often the source of infection for children.[19]Treatment[edit]The antibiotics erythromycin, clarithromycin, or azithromycin are typically the recommended treatment.[41] Newer macrolides are frequently recommended due to lower rates of side effects.[6] Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) may be used in those with allergies to first-line agents or in infants who have a risk of pyloric stenosis from macrolides.[6]A reasonable guideline is to treat people age >1 year within 3 weeks of cough onset and infants age <1 year and pregnant women within 6 weeks of cough onset. If the person is diagnosed late, antibiotics will not alter the course of the illness, and even without antibiotics, they should no longer be spreading pertussis.[6] When used early, antibiotics decrease the duration of infectiousness, and thus prevent spread.[6] Short-term antibiotics (azithromycin for 3–5 days) are as effective as long-term treatment (erythromycin 10–14 days) in eliminating B. pertussis with fewer and less severe side effects.[41]People with pertussis are most infectious during the first two weeks following the onset of symptoms.[54]Effective treatments of the cough associated with this condition have not been developed.[55] The use of over the counter cough medications is discouraged and has not been found helpful.[20]Prognosis[edit]Disability-adjusted life year for pertussis per 100,000inhabitants as of 2004..mw-parser-output .refbegin{font-size:90%;margin-bottom:0.5em}.mw-parser-output .refbegin-hanging-indents>ul{list-style-type:none;margin-left:0}.mw-parser-output .refbegin-hanging-indents>ul>li,.mw-parser-output .refbegin-hanging-indents>dl>dd{margin-left:0;padding-left:3.2em;text-indent:-3.2em;list-style:none}.mw-parser-output .refbegin-100{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .refbegin-columns{margin-top:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .refbegin-columns dl,.mw-parser-output .refbegin-columns ol,.mw-parser-output .refbegin-columns ul{margin-top:0}.mw-parser-output .refbegin-columns li,.mw-parser-output .refbegin-columns dd{page-break-inside:avoid;break-inside:avoid-column} .mw-parser-output .legend{page-break-inside:avoid;break-inside:avoid-column}.mw-parser-output .legend-color{display:inline-block;min-width:1.25em;height:1.25em;line-height:1.25;margin:1px 0;text-align:center;border:1px solid black;background-color:transparent;color:black}.mw-parser-output .legend-text{}No data Less than 50 50–100 100–150 150–200 200–250 250–300 300–350 350–400 400–450 450–500 500–550 More than 550 While most healthy older children and adults fully recover, infection in newborns is particularly severe. Pertussis is fatal in an estimated 0.5% of US infants under one year of age.[56] First-year infants are also more likely to develop complications, such as: apneas (31%), pneumonia (12%), seizures (0.6%) and encephalopathy (0.15%).[56] This may be due to the ability of the bacterium to suppress the immune system.[57]Epidemiology[edit]Whooping cough deaths per million persons in 20120–0.9 1–1.9 2–3 4–4.9 5–5.9 6–32 33–38 39–44 45–79 Worldwide, whooping cough affects around 16 million people yearly.[16] One estimate for 2013 stated it resulted in about 61,000 deaths – down from 138,000 deaths in 1990.[17] Another estimated 195,000 child deaths yearly from the disease worldwide.[58] This is despite generally high coverage with the DTP and DTaP vaccines. Pertussis is one of the leading causes of vaccine-preventable deaths worldwide.[59] About 90% of all cases occur in developing countries.[59]Before vaccines, an average of 178,171 cases was reported in the U.S., with peaks reported every two to five years; more than 93% of reported cases occurred in children under 10 years of age. The actual incidence was likely much higher. After vaccinations were introduced in the 1940s, pertussis incidence fell dramatically to approximately 1,000 by 1976. Incidence rates have increased since 1980. In 2015, rates in the United States were 20,762 people.[60]Pertussis is the only vaccine-preventable disease that is associated with increasing deaths in the U.S. The number of deaths increased from four in 1996 to 17 in 2001, almost all of which were infants under one year.[61] In Canada, the number of pertussis infections has varied between 2,000 and 10,000 reported cases each year over the last ten years, and it is the most common vaccine-preventable illness in Toronto.[62]In 2009 Australia reported an average of 10,000 cases a year, and the number of cases had increased.[63] In the U.S. pertussis in adults has increased significantly since about 2004.[64]In 2017, India had a reported 23,766 reported pertussis cases, making it one of the highest reported number of cases of the year.[65] Other countries, such as Germany, had reported 16,183 cases, while Australia and China had a reported number of 12,114 and 10,390 pertussis cases.[65]US outbreaks[edit]An epidemiologist tests blood samples for pertussis during a 2010 outbreak.In 2010 ten infants in California died, and health authorities declared an epidemic encompassing 9,120 cases.[66][67] They found that doctors had failed to correctly diagnose the infants\\' condition during several visits.[68] Statistical analysis identified significant overlap in communities with a cluster of nonmedical child exemptions and cases. The number of exemptions varied widely among communities, but tended to be highly clustered. In some schools, more than three-quarters of parents filed for vaccination exemptions. The data suggest vaccine refusal based on nonmedical reasons and personal belief exacerbated the outbreak. Other factors included reduced duration of immunity following the acellular vaccine and, the fact that most vaccinated adults and older children had not received a booster shot.[69][70]In April and May 2012 pertussis was declared to be at epidemic levels in Washington, with 3,308 cases.[71][72][73] In December 2012 Vermont declared an epidemic of 522 cases.[74] Wisconsin had the highest incidence rate, with 3,877 cases, although it did not make an official epidemic declaration.[73]History[edit]Discovery[edit]B. pertussis was discovered in 1906 by Jules Bordet and Octave Gengou, who also developed the first serology and vaccine. Efforts to develop an inactivated whole-cell vaccine began soon after B. pertussis was cultured that year. In the 1920s, Louis W. Sauer developed a weak vaccine for whooping cough at Evanston Hospital (Evanston, IL). In 1925 Danish physician Thorvald Madsen was the first to test a whole-cell vaccine on a wide scale.[75] Madsen used the vaccine to control outbreaks in the Faroe Islands in the North Sea.Vaccine[edit]In 1932 an outbreak of whooping cough hit Atlanta, Georgia, prompting pediatrician Leila Denmark to begin her study of the disease. Over the next six years her work was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, and in partnership with Emory University and Eli Lilly & Company, she developed the first pertussis vaccine.[76] In 1942 American scientists Grace Eldering, Loney Gordon, and Pearl Kendrick combined the whole-cell pertussis vaccine with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids to generate the first DTP combination vaccine.[77] To minimize the frequent side effects caused by the pertussis component, Japanese scientist Yuji Sato developed an acellular vaccine consisting of purified haemagglutinins (HAs: filamentous strep throat and leukocytosis-promoting-factor HA), which are secreted by B. pertussis. Sato\\'s acellular pertussis vaccine was used in Japan starting in 1981.[78] Later versions of the acellular vaccine in other countries consisted of additional defined components of B. pertussis and were often part of the DTaP combination vaccine.References[edit]^ a b c d e f g h i .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}\"Pertussis (Whooping Cough) Signs & Symptoms\". 22 May 2014.

however, people may still have the infection even if the results are negative.[2] A type of polymerase chain reaction that detects the virus\\'s RNA is more accurate.[2]Frequent hand washing reduces the risk of viral spread, as does wearing a surgical mask.[3][needs update] Yearly vaccinations against influenza are recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for those at high risk,[1] and by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for those six months of age and older.[11] The vaccine is usually effective against three or four types of influenza.[1] It is usually well tolerated.[1] A vaccine made for one year may not be useful in the following year, since the virus evolves rapidly.[1] Antiviral medications such as the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir, among others, have been used to treat influenza.[1] The benefit of antiviral medications in those who are otherwise healthy do not appear to be greater than their risks.[12] No benefit has been found in those with other health problems.[12][13]Influenza spreads around the world in yearly outbreaks, resulting in about three to five million cases of severe illness and about 290,000 to 650,000 deaths.[1][4] About 20% of unvaccinated children and 10% of unvaccinated adults are infected each year.[14] In the northern and southern parts of the world, outbreaks occur mainly in the winter, while around the equator, outbreaks may occur at any time of the year.[1] Death occurs mostly in high risk groups—the young, the old, and those with other health problems.[1] Larger outbreaks known as pandemics are less frequent.[2] In the 20th century, three influenza pandemics occurred: Spanish influenza in 1918 (17–100million deaths), Asian influenza in 1957 (two million deaths), and Hong Kong influenza in 1968 (one million deaths).[15][16][17] The World Health Organization declared an outbreak of a new type of influenza A/H1N1 to be a pandemic in June 2009.[18] Influenza may also affect other animals, including pigs, horses, and birds.[19].mw-parser-output .toclimit-2 .toclevel-1 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-3 .toclevel-2 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-4 .toclevel-3 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-5 .toclevel-4 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-6 .toclevel-5 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-7 .toclevel-6 ul{display:none}Contents1 Signs and symptoms1.1 Symptoms of influenza1.2 Emergency warning signs1.2.1 Signs of dehydration2 Virology2.1 Types of virus2.1.1 Influenzavirus A2.1.2 Influenzavirus B2.1.3 Influenzavirus C2.1.4 Influenzavirus D2.2 Structure, properties, and subtype nomenclature2.3 Replication3 Mechanism3.1 Transmission3.2 Pathophysiology4 Prevention4.1 Vaccination4.2 Infection control5 Diagnosis6 Treatment6.1 Antivirals6.1.1 Neuraminidase inhibitors6.1.2 M2 inhibitors7 Prognosis7.1 Neurological complications8 Epidemiology8.1 Seasonal variations8.2 Mortality8.3 Outbreaks9 History9.1 Etymology9.2 Pandemics10 Society and culture11 Research12 Other animals12.1 Bird flu12.2 Swine flu13 References14 Further reading15 External linksSigns and symptomsMost sensitive symptoms for diagnosing influenza[20]Symptom:SensitivitySpecificityFever68–86%25–73%Cough84–98%7–29%Nasal congestion68–91%19–41%All three findings, especially fever, were less sensitive in people over 60 years of age.Symptoms of influenza,[21][22] with fever and cough the most common symptoms.[20]Approximately 33% of people with influenza are asymptomatic.[23][24]Symptoms of influenza can start quite suddenly three to four days after infection.[25] Usually the first symptoms are chills and body aches, with fever also common early in the infection, with body temperatures ranging from 38 to 39°C (approximately 100 to 103°F).[26] Many people are so ill that they are confined to bed for several days, with aches and pains throughout their bodies, which are worse in their backs and legs.[27]Symptoms of influenzaFever and chillsCoughNasal congestionRunny noseSore throatHoarsenessEaracheMuscle painsFatigueHeadacheIrritated, watering eyesReddened eyes, skin (especially face), mouth, throat and nosePetechial rash[28]In children, gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain[29][30] (may be severe in children with influenza B)[31]It can be difficult to distinguish between the common cold and influenza in the early stages of these infections.[32] Influenza symptoms are a mixture of symptoms of common cold and pneumonia, body ache, headache, and fatigue. Diarrhea is not usually a symptom of influenza in adults,[20] although it has been seen in some human cases of the H5N1 \"bird flu\"[33] and can be a symptom in children.[29] The symptoms most reliably seen in influenza are shown in the adjacent table.[20]The specific combination of fever and cough has been found to be the best predictor; diagnostic accuracy increases with a body temperature above 38°C (100.4°F).[34] Two decision analysis studies[35][36] suggest that during local outbreaks of influenza, the prevalence will be over 70%.[36] Even in the absence of a local outbreak, diagnosis may be justified in the elderly during the influenza season as long as the prevalence is over 15%.[36]The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) maintains an up-to-date summary of available laboratory tests.[37] According to the CDC, rapid diagnostic tests have a sensitivity of 50–75% and specificity of 90–95% when compared with viral culture.[38]Occasionally, influenza can cause severe illness including primary viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia.[39][40] The obvious symptom is trouble breathing. In addition, if a child (or presumably an adult) seems to be getting better and then relapses with a high fever, that is a danger sign since this relapse can be bacterial pneumonia.[41]Sometimes, influenza may have abnormal presentations, like confusion in the elderly and a sepsis-like syndrome in the young.[42]Emergency warning signsShortness of breathChest painDizzinessConfusionExtreme vomitingFlu symptoms that improve but then relapse with a high fever and severe cough (can be bacterial pneumonia)CyanosisHigh fever and a rash.Inability to drink fluidsSigns of dehydration(In infants) far fewer wet diapers than usual[43]Cannot keep down fluids(In infants) no tears when cryingVirologyTypes of virusStructure of the influenza virion. The hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins are shown on the surface of the particle. The viral RNAs that make up the genome are shown as red coils inside the particle and bound to ribonucleoproteins (RNP).In virus classification, influenza viruses are negative sense RNA viruses that make up four of the seven genera of the family Orthomyxoviridae:[44]Influenzavirus AInfluenzavirus BInfluenzavirus CInfluenzavirus DThese viruses are only distantly related to the human parainfluenza viruses, which are RNA viruses belonging to the paramyxovirus family that are a common cause of respiratory infections in children such as croup,[45] but can also cause a disease similar to influenza in adults.[46]The fourth family of influenza viruses – Influenza D – was identified in 2016.[47][48][49][50][51][52][53] The type species for this family is Influenza D virus, which was first isolated in 2011.[8]Influenzavirus AThis genus has one species, influenza A virus. Wild aquatic birds are the natural hosts for a large variety of influenza A.[54] Occasionally, viruses are transmitted to other species and may then cause devastating outbreaks in domestic poultry or give rise to human influenza pandemics.[54] The influenza A virus can be subdivided into different serotypes based on the antibody response to these viruses.[55] The serotypes that have been confirmed in humans are:H1N1, which caused Spanish flu in 1918, and Swine Flu in 2009H2N2, which caused Asian Flu in 1957H3N2, which caused Hong Kong Flu in 1968H5N1, which caused Bird Flu in 2004[56][57]H7N7, which has unusual zoonotic potential[58]H1N2, endemic in humans, pigs and birdsH9N2H7N2H7N3H10N7H7N9, rated in 2018 as having the greatest pandemic potential among the Type A subtypes[59]H6N1, which only infected one person, who recovered[60]Influenzavirus BInfluenza virus nomenclature (for a Fujian flu virus)This genus has one species, influenza B virus. Influenza B almost exclusively infects humans[55] and is less common than influenza A. The only other animals known to be susceptible to influenza B infection areseals[61] and ferrets.[62] This type of influenza mutates at a rate 2–3 times slower than type A[63] and consequently is less genetically diverse, with only one influenza B serotype.[55] As a result of this lack of antigenic diversity, a degree of immunity to influenza B is usually acquired at an early age. However, influenza B mutates enough that lasting immunity is not possible.[64] This reduced rate of antigenic change, combined with its limited host range (inhibiting cross species antigenic shift), ensures that pandemics of influenza B do not occur.[65]Influenzavirus CThis genus has one species, influenza C virus, which infects humans, dogs and pigs, sometimes causing both severe illness and local epidemics.[66][67] However, influenza C is less common than the other types and usually only causes mild disease in children.[68][69]Influenzavirus DThis genus has only one species, influenza D virus, which infects pigs and cattle. The virus has the potential to infect humans, although no such cases have been observed.[8]Structure, properties, and subtype nomenclatureInfluenzaviruses A, B, C, and D are very similar in overall structure.[8][70][71] The virus particle (also called the virion) is 80–120 nanometers in diameter such that the smallest virions adopt an elliptical shape.[72] The length of each particle varies considerably, owing to the fact that influenza is pleomorphic, and can be in excess of many tens of micrometers, producing filamentous virions.[73] However, despite these varied shapes, the viral particles of all influenza viruses are similar in composition.[74] These are made of a viral envelope containing the glycoproteins hemagglutinin and neuraminidase wrapped around a central core. The central core contains the viral RNA genome and other viral proteins that package and protect this RNA. RNA tends to be single stranded but in special cases it is double.[75] Unusually for a virus, its genome is not a single piece of nucleic acid; instead, it contains seven or eight pieces of segmented negative-sense RNA, each piece of RNA containing either one or two genes, which code for a gene product (protein).[74] For example, the influenza A genome contains 11 genes on eight pieces of RNA, encoding for 11 proteins: hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), nucleoprotein (NP), M1 (matrix 1 protein), M2, NS1 (non-structural protein 1), NS2 (other name is NEP, nuclear export protein), PA, PB1 (polymerase basic 1), PB1-F2 and PB2.[76]Hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are the two large glycoproteins on the outside of the viral particles. HA is a lectin that mediates binding of the virus to target cells and entry of the viral genome into the target cell, while NA is involved in the release of progeny virus from infected cells, by cleaving sugars that bind the mature viral particles.[77] Thus, these proteins are targets for antiviral medications.[78] Furthermore, they are antigens to which antibodies can be raised. Influenza A viruses are classified into subtypes based on antibody responses to HA and NA. These different types of HA and NA form the basis of the H and N distinctions in, for example, H5N1.[79] There are 18 H and 11 N subtypes known, but only H 1, 2 and 3, and N 1 and 2 are commonly found in humans.[80][81]ReplicationHost cell invasion and replication by the influenza virus. The steps in this process are discussed in the text.Viruses can replicate only in living cells.[82] Influenza infection and replication is a multi-step process: First, the virus has to bind to and enter the cell, then deliver its genome to a site where it can produce new copies of viral proteins and RNA, assemble these components into new viral particles, and, last, exit the host cell.[74]Influenza viruses bind through hemagglutinin onto sialic acid sugars on the surfaces of epithelial cells, typically in the nose, throat, and lungs of mammals, and intestines of birds (Stage 1 in infection figure).[83] After the hemagglutinin is cleaved by a protease, the cell imports the virus by endocytosis.[84]The intracellular details are still being elucidated. It is known that virions converge to the microtubule organizing center, interact with acidic endosomes and finally enter the target endosomes for genome release.[85]Once inside the cell, the acidic conditions in the endosome cause two events to happen: First, part of the hemagglutinin protein fuses the viral envelope with the vacuole\\'s membrane, then the M2 ion channel allows protons to move through the viral envelope and acidify the core of the virus, which causes the core to disassemble and release the viral RNA and core proteins.[74] The viral RNA (vRNA) molecules, accessory proteins and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase are then released into the cytoplasm (Stage 2).[86] The M2 ion channel is blocked by amantadine drugs, preventing infection.[87]These core proteins and vRNA form a complex that is transported into the cell nucleus, where the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase begins transcribing complementary positive-sense vRNA (Steps 3a and b).[88] The vRNA either is exported into the cytoplasm and translated (step 4) or remains in the nucleus. Newly synthesized viral proteins are either secreted through the Golgi apparatus onto the cell surface (in the case of neuraminidase and hemagglutinin, step 5b) or transported back into the nucleus to bind vRNA and form new viral genome particles (step 5a). Other viral proteins have multiple actions in the host cell, including degrading cellular mRNA and using the released nucleotides for vRNA synthesis and also inhibiting translation of host-cell mRNAs.[89]Negative-sense vRNAs that form the genomes of future viruses, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and other viral proteins are assembled into a virion. Hemagglutinin and neuraminidase molecules cluster into a bulge in the cell membrane. The vRNA and viral core proteins leave the nucleus and enter this membrane protrusion (step 6). The mature virus buds off from the cell in a sphere of host phospholipid membrane, acquiring hemagglutinin and neuraminidase with this membrane coat (step 7).[90] As before, the viruses adhere to the cell through hemagglutinin; the mature viruses detach once their neuraminidase has cleaved sialic acid residues from the host cell.[83] After the release of new influenza viruses, the host cell dies.Because of the absence of RNA proofreading enzymes, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that copies the viral genome makes an error roughly every 10 thousand nucleotides, which is the approximate length of the influenza vRNA. Hence, the majority of newly manufactured influenza viruses are mutants; this causes antigenic drift, which is a slow change in the antigens on the viral surface over time.[91] The separation of the genome into eight separate segments of vRNA allows mixing or reassortment of vRNAs if more than one type of influenza virus infects a single cell. The resulting rapid change in viral genetics produces antigenic shifts, which are sudden changes from one antigen to another. These sudden large changes allow the virus to infect new host species and quickly overcome protective immunity.[79] This is important in the emergence of pandemics, as discussed below in the section on epidemiology.Also, when two or more viruses infect a cell, genetic variation may be generated by homologous recombination.[92][93]Homologous recombination can arise during viral genome replication by the RNA polymerase switching from one template to another, a process known as copy choice.[93]MechanismTransmissionWhen an infected person sneezes or coughs more than half a million virus particles can be spread to those close by.[94] In otherwise healthy adults, influenza virus shedding (the time during which a person might be infectious to another person) increases sharply one-half to one day after infection, peaks on day 2 and persists for an average total duration of 5 days—but can persist as long as 9 days.[23] In those who develop symptoms from experimental infection (only 67% of healthy experimentally infected individuals), symptoms and viral shedding show a similar pattern, but with viral shedding preceding illness by one day.[23] Children are much more infectious than adults and shed virus from just before they develop symptoms until two weeks after infection.[95] In immunocompromised people, viral shedding can continue for longer than two weeks.[96]Influenza can be spread in three main ways:[97][98] by direct transmission (when an infected person sneezes mucus directly into the eyes, nose or mouth of another person); the airborne route (when someone inhales the aerosols produced by an infected person coughing, sneezing or spitting) and through hand-to-eye, hand-to-nose, or hand-to-mouth transmission, either from contaminated surfaces or from direct personal contact such as a handshake. The relative importance of these three modes of transmission is unclear, and they may all contribute to the spread of the virus.[9] In the airborne route, the droplets that are small enough for people to inhale are 0.5 to 5μm in diameter and inhaling just one droplet might be enough to cause an infection.[97] Although a single sneeze releases up to 40,000 droplets,[99] most of these droplets are quite large and will quickly settle out of the air.[97] How long influenza survives in airborne droplets seems to be influenced by the levels of humidity and UV radiation, with low humidity and a lack of sunlight in winter aiding its survival;[97] ideal conditions can allow it to live for an hour in the atmosphere.[100]As the influenza virus can persist outside of the body, it can also be transmitted by contaminated surfaces such as banknotes,[101] doorknobs, light switches and other household items.[27] The length of time the virus will persist on a surface varies, with the virus surviving for one to two days on hard, non-porous surfaces such as plastic or metal, for about fifteen minutes on dry paper tissues, and only five minutes on skin.[102] However, if the virus is present in mucus, this can protect it for longer periods (up to 17days on banknotes).[97][101] Avian influenza viruses can survive indefinitely when frozen.[103] They are inactivated by heating to 56°C (133°F) for a minimum of 60 minutes, as well as by acids (at pH <2).[103]PathophysiologyThe different sites of infection (shown in red) of seasonal H1N1 versus avian H5N1. This influences their lethality and ability to spread.The mechanisms by which influenza infection causes symptoms in humans have been studied intensively. One of the mechanisms is believed to be the inhibition of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) resulting in lowered cortisol levels.[104]Knowing which genes are carried by a particular strain can help predict how well it will infect humans and how severe this infection will be (that is, predict the strain\\'s pathophysiology).[67][105]For instance, part of the process that allows influenza viruses to invade cells is the cleavage of the viral hemagglutinin protein by any one of several human proteases.[84] In mild and avirulent viruses, the structure of the hemagglutinin means that it can only be cleaved by proteases found in the throat and lungs, so these viruses cannot infect other tissues. However, in highly virulent strains, such as H5N1, the hemagglutinin can be cleaved by a wide variety of proteases, allowing the virus to spread throughout the body.[105]The viral hemagglutinin protein is responsible for determining both which species a strain can infect and where in the human respiratory tract a strain of influenza will bind.[106] Strains that are easily transmitted between people have hemagglutinin proteins that bind to receptors in the upper part of the respiratory tract, such as in the nose, throat and mouth. In contrast, the highly lethal H5N1 strain binds to receptors that are mostly found deep in the lungs.[107] This difference in the site of infection may be part of the reason why the H5N1 strain causes severe viral pneumonia in the lungs, but is not easily transmitted by people coughing and sneezing.[108][109]Common symptoms of the flu such as fever, headaches, and fatigue are the result of the huge amounts of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (such as interferon or tumor necrosis factor) produced from influenza-infected cells.[32][110] In contrast to the rhinovirus that causes the common cold, influenza does cause tissue damage, so symptoms are not entirely due to the inflammatory response.[111] This massive immune response might produce a life-threatening cytokine storm. This effect has been proposed to be the cause of the unusual lethality of both the H5N1 avian influenza,[112] and the 1918 pandemic strain.[113][114] However, another possibility is that these large amounts of cytokines are just a result of the massive levels of viral replication produced by these strains, and the immune response does not itself contribute to the disease.[115] Influenza appears to trigger programmed cell death (apoptosis).[116]PreventionVaccinationMain article: Influenza vaccineGiving an influenza vaccinationThe influenza vaccine is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for high-risk groups, such as pregnant women, children aged less than five years, the elderly, health care workers, and people who have chronic illnesses such as HIV/AIDS, asthma, diabetes, heart disease, or are immunocompromised among others.[117][118] The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the influenza vaccine for those aged six months or older who do not have contraindications.[119][11] In healthy adults it is modestly effective in decreasing the amount of influenza-like symptoms in a population.[120] In healthy children over the age of two years, the vaccine reduces the chances of getting influenza by around two-thirds, while it has not been well studied in children under two years.[121] In those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease vaccination reduces exacerbations;[122] it is not clear if it reduces asthma exacerbations.[123] Evidence supports a lower rate of influenza-like illness in many groups who are immunocompromised such as those with: HIV/AIDS, cancer, and post organ transplant.[124] In those at high risk immunization may reduce the risk of heart disease.[125] Whether immunizing health care workers affects patient outcomes is controversial with some reviews finding insufficient evidence[126][127] and others finding tentative evidence.[128][129]Due to the high mutation rate of the virus, a particular influenza vaccine usually confers protection for no more than a few years. Each year, the World Health Organization predicts which strains of the virus are most likely to be circulating in the next year (see Historical annual reformulations of the influenza vaccine), allowing pharmaceutical companies to develop vaccines that will provide the best immunity against these strains.[130] The vaccine is reformulated each season for a few specific flu strains but does not include all the strains active in the world during that season. It takes about six months for the manufacturers to formulate and produce the millions of doses required to deal with the seasonal epidemics; occasionally, a new or overlooked strain becomes prominent during that time.[131] It is also possible to get infected just before vaccination and get sick with the strain that the vaccine is supposed to prevent, as the vaccine takes about two weeks to become effective.[132]Vaccines can cause the immune system to react as if the body were actually being infected, and general infection symptoms (many cold and flu symptoms are just general infection symptoms) can appear, though these symptoms are usually not as severe or long-lasting as influenza. The most dangerous adverse effect is a severe allergic reaction to either the virus material itself or residues from the hen eggs used to grow the influenza; however, these reactions are extremely rare.[133]A 2018 Cochrane review of children in good general health found that the live immunization seemed to lower the risk of getting influenza for the season from 18% to 4%. The inactivated vaccine seemed to lower the risk of getting flu for the season from 30% to 11%. Not enough data was available to draw definite conclusions about serious complications such as pneumonia or hospitalization.[121]For healthy adults, a 2018 Cochrane review showed that vaccines reduced the incidence of lab-confirmed influenza from 2.3% to 0.9%, which constitutes a reduction of risk of approximately 60%. However, for influenza-like illness which is defined as the same symptoms of cough, fever, headache, runny nose, and bodily aches and pains, vaccine reduced the risk from 21.5% to 18.1%. This constitutes a much more modest reduction of risk of approximately 16%. The difference is most probably explained by the fact that over 200 viruses cause the same or similar symptoms as the flu virus.[120] Another review looked at the effect of short and long term exercise before the vaccine, however, no benefits or harms were recorded.[134]The cost-effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccination has been widely evaluated for different groups and in different settings.[135] It has generally been found to be a cost-effective intervention, especially in children[136] and the elderly,[137] however the results of economic evaluations of influenza vaccination have often been found to be dependent on key assumptions.[138][139]Infection controlFurther information: Influenza preventionThese are the main ways that influenza spreadsby direct transmission (when an infected person sneezes mucus directly into the eyes, nose or mouth of another person);the airborne route (when someone inhales the aerosols produced by an infected person coughing, sneezing or spitting);through hand-to-eye, hand-to-nose, or hand-to-mouth transmission, either from contaminated surfaces or from direct personal contact such as a hand-shake.When vaccines and antiviral medications are limited, non-pharmaceutical interventions are essential to reduce transmission and spread. The lack of controlled studies and rigorous evidence of the effectiveness of some measures has hampered planning decisions and recommendations. Nevertheless, strategies endorsed by experts for all phases of flu outbreaks include hand and respiratory hygiene, self-isolation by symptomatic individuals and the use of face masks by them and their caregivers, surface disinfection, rapid testing and diagnosis, and contact tracing. In some cases, other forms of social distancing including school closures and travel restrictions are recommended.[140]Reasonably effective ways to reduce the transmission of influenza include good personal health and hygiene habits such as: not touching the eyes, nose or mouth;[141] frequent hand washing (with soap and water, or with alcohol-based hand rubs);[142] covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue or sleeve; avoiding close contact with sick people; and staying home when sick. Avoiding spitting is also recommended.[140] Although face masks might help prevent transmission when caring for the sick,[143][144] there is mixed evidence on beneficial effects in the community.[140][145] Smoking raises the risk of contracting influenza, as well as producing more severe disease symptoms.[146][147]Since influenza spreads through both aerosols and contact with contaminated surfaces, surface sanitizing may help prevent some infections.[148] Alcohol is an effective sanitizer against influenza viruses, while quaternary ammonium compounds can be used with alcohol so that the sanitizing effect lasts for longer.[149] In hospitals, quaternary ammonium compounds and bleach are used to sanitize rooms or equipment that have been occupied by people with influenza symptoms.[149] At home, this can be done effectively with a diluted chlorine bleach.[150]Social distancing strategies used during past pandemics, such as quarantines, travel restrictions, and the closing of schools, churches and theaters, have been employed to slow the spread of influenza viruses. Researchers have estimated that such interventions during the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic in the US reduced the peak death rate by up to 50%, and the overall mortality by about 10–30%, in areas where multiple interventions were implemented. The more moderate effect on total deaths was attributed to the measures being employed too late, or lifted too early, most after six weeks or less.[151][152]For typical flu outbreaks, routine cancellation of large gatherings or mandatory travel restrictions have received little agreement, particularly as they may be disruptive and unpopular. School closures have been found by most empirical studies to reduce community spread, but some findings have been contradictory. Recommendations for these community restrictions are usually on a case-by-case basis.[140]Diagnosis29 yr old with H1N1There are a number of rapid tests for the flu. One is called a Rapid Molecular Assay, when an upper respiratory tract specimen (mucus) is taken using a nasal swab or a nasopharyngeal swab.[153] It should be done within 3–4 days of symptom onset, as upper respiratory viral shedding takes a downward spiral after that.[42]TreatmentMain article: Influenza treatmentPeople with the flu are advised to get plenty of rest, drink plenty of liquids, avoid using alcohol and tobacco and, if necessary, take medications such as acetaminophen (paracetamol) to relieve the fever and muscle aches associated with the flu.[154][155] In contrast, there is not enough evidence to support corticosteroids as additional therapy for influenza.[156] It is advised to avoid close contact with others to prevent spread of infection.[154][155] Children and teenagers with flu symptoms (particularly fever) should avoid taking aspirin during an influenza infection (especially influenza type B), because doing so can lead to Reye\\'s syndrome, a rare but potentially fatal disease of the liver.[157] Since influenza is caused by a virus, antibiotics have no effect on the infection, but may be prescribed for secondary infections such as bacterial pneumonia. Antiviral medication may be effective, if given early (within 48 hours to first symptoms), but some strains of influenza can show resistance to the standard antiviral medications and there is concern about the quality of the research.[158]AntiviralsThe two classes of antiviral medications used against influenza are neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, laninamivir and peramivir) and M2 protein inhibitors (adamantane derivatives).[159][160][161] In Russia, umifenovir is sold for treatment of influenza[162] and in the first quarter of 2020 had a 16 percent share in the antiviral market.[163]Neuraminidase inhibitorsOverall the benefits of neuraminidase inhibitors in those who are otherwise healthy do not appear to be greater than the risks.[12] There does not appear to be any benefit in those with other health problems.[12] In those believed to have the flu, they decreased the length of time symptoms were present by slightly less than a day but did not appear to affect the risk of complications such as needing hospitalization or pneumonia.[13] Increasingly prevalent resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors has led researchers to seek alternative antiviral medications with different mechanisms of action.[164]M2 inhibitorsThe antiviral medications amantadine and rimantadine inhibit a viral ion channel (M2 protein), thus inhibiting replication of the influenza A virus.[87] These medications are sometimes effective against influenza A if given early in the infection but are ineffective against influenza B viruses, which lack the M2 drug target.[165] Measured resistance to amantadine and rimantadine in American isolates of H3N2 has increased to 91% in 2005.[166] This high level of resistance may be due to the easy availability of amantadines as part of over-the-counter cold remedies in countries such as China and Russia,[167] and their use to prevent outbreaks of influenza in farmed poultry.[168][169] The CDC recommended against using M2 inhibitors during the 2005–06 influenza season due to high levels of drug resistance.[170]PrognosisInfluenza\\'s effects are much more severe and last longer than those of the common cold. Most people will recover completely in about one to two weeks, but others will develop life-threatening complications (such as pneumonia). Thus, influenza can be deadly, especially for the weak, young and old, those with compromised immune systems, or the chronically ill.[79] People with a weak immune system, such as people with advanced HIV infection or transplant recipients (whose immune systems are medically suppressed to prevent transplant organ rejection), suffer from particularly severe disease.[171] Pregnant women and young children are also at a high risk for complications.[172]The flu can worsen chronic health problems. People with emphysema, chronic bronchitis or asthma may experience shortness of breath while they have the flu, and influenza may cause worsening of coronary heart disease or congestive heart failure.[173] Smoking is another risk factor associated with more serious disease and increased mortality from influenza.[146]Even healthy people can be affected, and serious problems from influenza can happen at any age. People over 65 years old, pregnant women, very young children and people of any age with chronic medical conditions are more likely to get complications from influenza, such as pneumonia, bronchitis, sinus, and ear infections.[174]Neurological complicationsInfluenza encephalitis MRIIn some cases, an autoimmune response to an influenza infection may contribute to the development of Guillain–Barré syndrome.[175] However, as many other infections can increase the risk of this disease, influenza may only be an important cause during epidemics.[175][176] This syndrome has been believed to also be a rare side effect of influenza vaccines. One review gives an incidence of about one case per million vaccinations.[177] Getting infected by influenza itself increases both the risk of death (up to 1 in 10,000) and increases the risk of developing GBS to a much higher level than the highest level of suspected vaccine involvement (approx. 10 times higher by recent estimates).[175][178]According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), \"Children of any age with neurologic conditions are more likely than other children to become very sick if they get the flu. Flu complications may vary and for some children, can include pneumonia and even death.\"[179]Neurological conditions can include:Disorders of the brain and spinal cordCerebral palsyEpilepsy (seizure disorders)StrokeIntellectual disabilityModerate to severe developmental delayMuscular dystrophySpinal cord injuryThese conditions can impair coughing, swallowing, clearing the airways, and in the worst cases, breathing. Therefore, they worsen the flu symptoms.[179]EpidemiologySeasonal variationsFurther information: Flu seasonSee also: United States influenza statistics by flu seasonSeasonal risk areas for influenza: November–April (blue), April–November (red), and year-round (yellow).Influenza reaches peak prevalence in winter, and because the Northern and Southern Hemispheres have winter at different times of the year, there are actually two different flu seasons each year. This is why the World Health Organization (assisted by the National Influenza Centers) makes recommendations for two different vaccine formulations every year; one for the Northern, and one for the Southern Hemisphere.[130]A long-standing puzzle has been why outbreaks of the flu occur seasonally rather than uniformly throughout the year. One possible explanation is that, because people are indoors more often during the winter, they are in close contact more often, and this promotes transmission from person to person. Increased travel due to the Northern Hemisphere winter holiday season may also play a role.[180] Another factor is that cold temperatures lead to drier air, which may dehydrate mucus particles. Dry particles are lighter and can thus remain airborne for a longer period. The virus also survives longer on surfaces at colder temperatures and aerosol transmission of the virus is highest in cold environments (less than 5°C) with low relative humidity.[181] The lower air humidity in winter seems to be the main cause of seasonal influenza transmission in temperate regions.[182][183]However, seasonal changes in infection rates also occur in tropical regions, and in some countries these peaks of infection are seen mainly during the rainy season.[184] Seasonal changes in contact rates from school terms, which are a major factor in other childhood diseases such as measles and pertussis, may also play a role in the flu. A combination of these small seasonal effects may be amplified by dynamical resonance with the endogenous disease cycles.[185] H5N1 exhibits seasonality in both humans and birds.[186][187]An alternative hypothesis to explain seasonality in influenza infections is an effect of vitamin D levels on immunity to the virus.[188] This idea was first proposed by Robert Edgar Hope-Simpson in 1981.[189] He proposed that the cause of influenza epidemics during winter may be connected to seasonal fluctuations of vitamin D, which is produced in the skin under the influence of solar (or artificial) UV radiation. This could explain why influenza occurs mostly in winter and during the tropical rainy season, when people stay indoors, away from the sun, and their vitamin D levels fall.MortalityInfluenza mortality in symptomatic cases in the US for the 2018/2019 season. The Y axis goes to 1%.[190]Every year about 290,000 to 650,000 people die due to influenza globally, with an average of 389,000.[191] In the developed world most of those who die are over the age of 65.[1] In the developing world the effects are less clear; however, it appears that children are affected to a greater degree.[1]Although the number of cases of influenza can vary widely between years, approximately 36,000 deaths and more than 200,000 hospitalizations are directly associated with influenza a year in the United States.[192][193] One method of calculating influenza mortality produced an estimate of 41,400 average deaths per year in the United States between 1979 and 2001.[194] Different methods in 2010 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported a range from a low of about 3,300 deaths to a high of 49,000 per year.[195]OutbreaksFurther information: Flu pandemicAs influenza is caused by a variety of species and strains of viruses, in any given year some strains can die out while others create epidemics, while yet another strain can cause a pandemic. Typically, in a year\\'s normal two flu seasons (one per hemisphere), there are between three and five million cases of severe illness,[1][4][196] which by some definitions is a yearly influenza epidemic.[1]Roughly three times per century, a pandemic occurs, which infects a large proportion of the world\\'s population and can kill tens of millions of people (see pandemics section). In 2006, a study estimated that if a strain with similar virulence to the 1918 influenza had emerged that year, it could have killed between 50 and 80million people.[197]Antigenic shift, or reassortment, can result in novel and highly pathogenic strains of human influenzaNew influenza viruses are constantly evolving by mutation or by reassortment.[55] Mutations can cause small changes in the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase antigens on the surface of the virus. This is called antigenic drift, which slowly creates an increasing variety of strains until one evolves that can infect people who are immune to the pre-existing strains. This new variant then replaces the older strains as it rapidly sweeps through the human population, often causing an epidemic.[198] However, since the strains produced by drift will still be reasonably similar to the older strains, some people will still be immune to them. In contrast, when influenza viruses reassort, they acquire completely new antigens—for example by reassortment between avian strains and human strains; this is called antigenic shift. If a human influenza virus is produced that has entirely new antigens, everybody will be susceptible, and the novel influenza will spread uncontrollably, causing a pandemic.[199] In contrast to this model of pandemics based on antigenic drift and shift, an alternative approach has been proposed where the periodic pandemics are produced by interactions of a fixed set of viral strains with a human population with a constantly changing set of immunities to different viral strains.[200]The generation time for influenza (the time from one infection to the next) is very short (only 2 days). This explains why influenza epidemics start and finish in a short time scale of only a few months.[201]From a public health point of view, flu epidemics spread rapidly and are very difficult to control. Most influenza virus strains are not very infectious and each infected individual will only go on to infect one or two other individuals (the basic reproduction number for influenza is generally around 1.4). However, the generation time for influenza is extremely short: the time from a person becoming infected to when he infects the next person is only two days. The short generation time means that influenza epidemics generally peak at around 2 months and burn out after 3 months: the decision to intervene in an influenza epidemic, therefore, has to be taken early, and the decision is therefore often made on the back of incomplete data. Another problem is that individuals become infectious before they become symptomatic, which means that putting people in quarantine after they become ill is not an effective public health intervention.[201] For the average person, viral shedding tends to peak on day two, whereas symptoms peak on day three.[23]HistoryEtymologyThe word Influenza comes from the Italian language meaning \"influence\" and refers to the cause of the disease; initially, this ascribed illness to unfavorable astrological influences. It was introduced into English in the mid-eighteenth century during a pan-European epidemic.[202]Archaic terms for influenza include epidemic catarrh, la grippe (from the French, first used by Molyneaux in 1694; also used in German),[203] sweating sickness, and Spanish fever (particularly for the 1918 flu pandemic strain).[204]PandemicsFurther information: Influenza pandemic, Spanish flu, and Hong Kong fluThe difference between the influenza mortality age distributions of the 1918 epidemic and normal epidemics. Deaths per 100,000 persons in each age group, United States, for the interpandemic years 1911–1917 (dashed line) and the pandemic year 1918 (solid line).[205]Thermal imaging camera and screen, photographed in an airport terminal in Greece during the 2009 flu pandemic. Thermal imaging can detect elevated body temperature, one of the signs of swine flu.An overall lack of data up until 1500 precludes meaningful search for the influenza outbreaks in the more distant past.[206] Possibly the first influenza pandemic occurred around 6000 BC in China.[206] The symptoms of human influenza were clearly described by Hippocrates roughly 2,400 years ago.[207][208] Although the virus seems to have caused epidemics throughout human history, historical data on influenza are difficult to interpret, because the symptoms can be similar to those of other respiratory diseases.[203][209] The disease may have spread from Europe to the Americas as early as the European colonization of the Americas, since almost the entire indigenous population of the Antilles was killed by an epidemic resembling influenza that broke out in 1493, after the arrival of Christopher Columbus.[210][211]The first convincing record of an influenza pandemic was a minor pandemic chronicled in 1510, which began in East Asia before spreading to North Africa and then Europe. During this pandemic, influenza killed about 1% of its victims.[212][213] The first pandemic of influenza to be reliably recorded as spreading worldwide was the 1557 influenza pandemic,[214][215][216][217] in which a reoccurring wave likely killed Queen Mary I of England and the Archbishop of Canterbury within 12 hours of each other.[218][219] One of the most well-chronicled pandemics of influenza in the 16th Century occurred in 1580, beginning in East Asia and spreading to Europe through Africa, Russia, and the Spanish and Ottoman Empires. In Rome, over 8,000 people were killed. Several Spanish cities saw large scale deaths, among the fatalities the Queen of Spain, Anna of Austria. Pandemics continued sporadically throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, with the pandemic of 1830–1833 being particularly widespread; it infected approximately a quarter of the people exposed.[203]The most lethal outbreak was the 1918 flu pandemic (Spanish flu) (type A influenza, H1N1 subtype), which lasted into 1920. It is not known exactly how many it killed, but estimates range from 17 million to 100million people.[15][205][220][221] This pandemic has been described as \"the greatest medical holocaust in history\" and may have killed as many people as the Black Death.[203] This huge death toll was caused by an extremely high infection rate of up to 50% and the extreme severity of the symptoms, suspected to be caused by cytokine storms.[221] Symptoms in 1918 were so unusual that initially influenza was misdiagnosed as dengue, cholera, or typhoid. One observer wrote, \"One of the most striking of the complications was hemorrhage from mucous membranes, especially from the nose, stomach, and intestine. Bleeding from the ears and petechial hemorrhages in the skin also occurred.\"[220] The majority of deaths were from bacterial pneumonia, a secondary infection caused by influenza, but the virus also killed people directly, causing massive hemorrhages and edema in the lung.[222]The 1918 flu pandemic was truly global, spreading even to the Arctic and remote Pacific islands. The unusually severe disease killed between two and twenty percent of those infected, as opposed to the more usual flu epidemic mortality rate of 0.1%.[205][220] Another unusual feature of this pandemic was that it mostly killed young adults, with 99% of pandemic influenza deaths occurring in people under 65, and more than half in young adults 20 to 40 years old.[223] This is unusual since influenza is normally most deadly to the very young (under age 2) and the very old (over age 70). The total mortality of the 1918–1919 pandemic is not known, but it is estimated that 2.5% to 5% of the world\\'s population was killed. As many as 25million may have been killed in the first 25 weeks; in contrast, HIV/AIDS has killed 25million in its first 25 years.[220]Later flu pandemics were not so devastating. They included the 1957 Asian flu (type A, H2N2 strain) and the 1968 Hong Kong flu (type A, H3N2 strain), but even these smaller outbreaks killed millions of people. In later pandemics antibiotics were available to control secondary infections and this may have helped reduce mortality compared to the Spanish flu of 1918.[205]Major modern influenza pandemics[224][225]NameDateWorld pop.SubtypeReproduction number[226]Infected (est.)Deaths worldwideCase fatality ratePandemic severity1889–90 flu pandemic[227]1889–901.53 billionLikely H3N8 or H2N22.10 (IQR,1.9–2.4)[227]20–60%[227] (300–900million)1million0.10–0.28%[227]21918 flu[228]1918–201.80 billionH1N11.80 (IQR,1.47–2.27)33% (500million)[229] or >56% (>1billion)[230]17[231]–100[232][233]million2–3%,[230] or ~4%, or ~10%[234]5Asian flu1957–582.90 billionH2N21.65 (IQR,1.53–1.70)>17% (>500million)[230]1–4million[230]<0.2%[230]2Hong Kong flu1968–693.53 billionH3N21.80 (IQR,1.56–1.85)>14% (>500million)[230]1–4million[230]<0.1%[230][235]22009 flu pandemic[236][237]2009–106.85 billionH1N1/091.46 (IQR,1.30–1.70)11–21% (0.7–1.4 billion)[238]151,700–575,400[239]0.01%[240][241]1Typical seasonal flu[t 1]Every year7.75 billionA/H3N2, A/H1N1, B, ...1.28 (IQR,1.19–1.37)5–15% (340million – 1billion)[242]3–11% or 5–20%[243][244] (240 million – 1.6 billion)290,000–650,000/year[245]<0.1%[246]1Notes^ Not pandemic, but included for comparison purposes.It was incorrectly assumed that the cause of influenza was bacterial in origin from 1892 (with Haemophilus influenzae being discovered by and suggested as the origin of influenza by R. F. J. Pfeiffer).[247] The first influenza virus to be isolated was from poultry, when in 1901, the agent causing a disease called \"fowl plague\" was passed through Chamberland filters, which have pores that are too small for bacteria to pass through.[248] However, the conceptual differences between viruses and bacteria as different entities was not fully understood for some time, complicating preventative measures taken during the 1918 influenza pandemic.[247] The etiological cause of influenza, the virus family Orthomyxoviridae, was first discovered in pigs by Richard Shope in 1931.[249] This discovery was shortly followed by the isolation of the virus from humans by a group headed by Patrick Laidlaw at the Medical Research Council of the United Kingdom in 1933.[250] However, it was not until Wendell Stanley first crystallized tobacco mosaic virus in 1935 that the non-cellular nature of viruses was appreciated.The main types of influenza viruses in humans. Solid squares show the appearance of a new strain, causing recurring influenza pandemics. Broken lines indicate uncertain strain identifications.[251]The first significant step towards preventing influenza was the development in 1944 of a killed-virus vaccine for influenza by Thomas Francis, Jr. This built on work by Australian Frank Macfarlane Burnet, who showed that the virus lost virulence when it was cultured in fertilized hen\\'s eggs.[252] Application of this observation by Francis allowed his group of researchers at the University of Michigan to develop the first influenza vaccine, with support from the U.S. Army.[253] The Army was deeply involved in this research due to its experience of influenza in World War I, when thousands of troops were killed by the virus in a matter of months.[220] In comparison to vaccines, the development of anti-influenza drugs has been slower, with amantadine being licensed in 1966 and, almost thirty years later, the next class of drugs (the neuraminidase inhibitors) being developed.[254]Society and cultureFurther information: Social impact of H5N1Influenza produces direct costs due to lost productivity and associated medical treatment, as well as indirect costs of preventive measures. In the United States, seasonal influenza is estimated to result in a total average annual economic cost of over $11\\u202fbillion, with direct medical costs estimated to be over $3billion annually.[255] It has been estimated that a future pandemic could cause hundreds of billions of dollars in direct and indirect costs.[256] However, the economic impacts of past pandemics have not been intensively studied, and some authors have suggested that the Spanish influenza actually had a positive long-term effect on per-capita income growth, despite a large reduction in the working population and severe short-term depressive effects.[257] Other studies have attempted to predict the costs of a pandemic as serious as the 1918 Spanish flu on the U.S. economy, where 30% of all workers became ill, and 2.5% were killed. A 30% sickness rate and a three-week length of illness would decrease the gross domestic product by 5%. Additional costs would come from medical treatment of 18million to 45million people, and total economic costs would be approximately $700billion.[258]Preventive costs are also high. Governments worldwide have spent billions of U.S. dollars preparing and planning for a potential H5N1 avian influenza pandemic, with costs associated with purchasing drugs and vaccines as well as developing disaster drills and strategies for improved border controls.[259] On 1 November 2005, United States President George W. Bush unveiled the National Strategy to Safeguard Against the Danger of Pandemic Influenza[256] backed by a request to Congress for $7.1billion to begin implementing the plan.[260] Internationally, on 18 January 2006, donor nations pledged US$2billion to combat bird flu at the two-day International Pledging Conference on Avian and Human Influenza held in China.[261][262]In an assessment of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic on selected countries in the Southern Hemisphere, data suggest that all countries experienced some time-limited and/or geographically isolated socioeconomic effects and a temporary decrease in tourism most likely due to fear of 2009 H1N1 disease. It is still too early to determine whether the H1N1 pandemic has had any long-term economic effects.[263][needs update]ResearchFurther information: Influenza researchDr. Terrence Tumpey examining a laboratory-grown reconstruction of the 1918 Spanish flu virus in a biosafety level 3 environment.Research on influenza includes studies on molecular virology, how the virus produces disease (pathogenesis), host immune responses, viral genomics, and how the virus spreads (epidemiology). These studies help in developing influenza countermeasures; for example, a better understanding of the body\\'s immune system response helps vaccine development, and a detailed picture of how influenza invades cells aids the development of antiviral drugs. One important basic research program is the Influenza Genome Sequencing Project, which was initiated in 2004 to create a library of influenza sequences and help clarify which factors make one strain more lethal than another, which genes most affect immunogenicity, and how the virus evolves over time.[264]The sequencing of the influenza genome and recombinant DNA technology may accelerate the generation of new vaccine strains by allowing scientists to substitute new antigens into a previously developed vaccine strain.[265] Growing viruses in cell culture also promises higher yields, less cost, better quality and surge capacity.[266] Research on a universal influenza A vaccine, targeted against the external domain of the transmembrane viral M2 protein (M2e), is being done at the University of Ghent by Walter Fiers, Xavier Saelens and their team[267][268][269] and has now successfully concluded Phase I clinical trials. There has been some research success towards a \"universal flu vaccine\" that produces antibodies against proteins on the viral coat which mutate less rapidly, and thus a single shot could potentially provide longer-lasting protection.[270][271][272]A number of biologics, therapeutic vaccines and immunobiologics are also being investigated for treatment of infection caused by viruses. Therapeutic biologics are designed to activate the immune response to virus or antigens. Typically, biologics do not target metabolic pathways like anti-viral drugs, but stimulate immune cells such as lymphocytes, macrophages, and/or antigen-presenting cells, in an effort to drive an immune response towards a cytotoxic effect against the virus. Influenza models, such as murine influenza, are convenient models to test the effects of prophylactic and therapeutic biologics. For example, lymphocyte T-cell immunomodulator inhibits viral growth in the murine model of influenza.[273]Other animalsH5N1Influenza A virussubtype H5N1Genetic structureInfectionHuman mortalityGlobal spreadin 2004in 2005in 2006in 2007Social impactPandemicVaccine.mw-parser-output .navbar{display:inline;font-size:88%;font-weight:normal}.mw-parser-output .navbar-collapse{float:left;text-align:left}.mw-parser-output .navbar-boxtext{word-spacing:0}.mw-parser-output .navbar ul{display:inline-block;white-space:nowrap;line-height:inherit}.mw-parser-output .navbar-brackets::before{margin-right:-0.125em;content:\"[ \"}.mw-parser-output .navbar-brackets::after{margin-left:-0.125em;content:\" ]\"}.mw-parser-output .navbar li{word-spacing:-0.125em}.mw-parser-output .navbar-mini abbr{font-variant:small-caps;border-bottom:none;text-decoration:none;cursor:inherit}.mw-parser-output .navbar-ct-full{font-size:114%;margin:0 7em}.mw-parser-output .navbar-ct-mini{font-size:114%;margin:0 4em}.mw-parser-output .infobox .navbar{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .navbox .navbar{display:block;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .navbox-title .navbar{float:left;text-align:left;margin-right:0.5em}vteFurther information: Influenzavirus A, H5N1, and Transmission and infection of H5N1Influenza infects many animal species, and transfer of viral strains between species can occur. Birds are thought to be the main animal reservoirs of influenza viruses.[274] Most influenza strains are believed to have originated after humans began their intensive domestication of animals about 10,000 years ago.[275] Sixteen forms of hemagglutinin and nine forms of neuraminidase have been identified. All known subtypes (HxNy) are found in birds, but many subtypes are endemic in humans, dogs, horses, and pigs; populations of camels, ferrets, cats, seals, mink, and whales also show evidence of prior infection or exposure to influenza.[64] Variants of flu virus are sometimes named according to the species the strain is endemic in or adapted to. The main variants named using this convention are: bird flu, human flu, swine flu, horse flu and dog flu. (Cat flu generally refers to feline viral rhinotracheitis or feline calicivirus and not infection from an influenza virus.) In pigs, horses and dogs, influenza symptoms are similar to humans, with cough, fever and loss of appetite.[64] The frequency of animal diseases are not as well-studied as human infection, but an outbreak of influenza in harbor seals caused approximately 500 seal deaths off the New England coast in 1979–1980.[276] However, outbreaks in pigs are common and do not cause severe mortality.[64] Vaccines have also been developed to protect poultry from avian influenza. These vaccines can be effective against multiple strains and are used either as part of a preventive strategy, or combined with culling in attempts to eradicate outbreaks.[277]Bird fluFlu symptoms in birds are variable and can be unspecific.[278] The symptoms following infection with low-pathogenicity avian influenza may be as mild as ruffled feathers, a small reduction in egg production, or weight loss combined with minor respiratory disease.[279] Since these mild symptoms can make diagnosis in the field difficult, tracking the spread of avian influenza requires laboratory testing of samples from infected birds. Some strains such as Asian H9N2 are highly virulent to poultry and may cause more extreme symptoms and significant mortality.[280] In its most highly pathogenic form, influenza in chickens and turkeys produces a sudden appearance of severe symptoms and almost 100% mortality within two days.[281] As the virus spreads rapidly in the crowded conditions seen in the intensive farming of chickens and turkeys, these outbreaks can cause large economic losses to poultry farmers.[citation needed]An avian-adapted, highly pathogenic strain of H5N1 (called HPAI A(H5N1), for \"highly pathogenic avian influenza virus of type A of subtype H5N1\") causes H5N1 flu, commonly known as \"avian influenza\" or simply \"bird flu\", and is endemic in many bird populations, especially in Southeast Asia. This Asian lineage strain of HPAI A(H5N1) is spreading globally. It is epizootic (an epidemic in non-humans) and panzootic (a disease affecting animals of many species, especially over a wide area), killing tens of millions of birds and spurring the culling of hundreds of millions of other birds in an attempt to control its spread. Most references in the media to \"bird flu\" and most references to H5N1 are about this specific strain.[282][283]HPAI A(H5N1) is an avian disease and there is no evidence suggesting efficient human-to-human transmission of HPAI A(H5N1). In almost all cases, those infected have had extensive physical contact with infected birds.[284] H5N1 may mutate or reassort into a strain capable of efficient human-to-human transmission. The exact changes that are required for this to happen are not well understood.[285] Due to the high lethality and virulence of H5N1, its endemic presence, and its large and increasing biological host reservoir, the H5N1 virus was the world\\'s major pandemic threat in the 2006–07 flu season, and billions of dollars are being raised and spent researching H5N1 and preparing for a potential influenza pandemic.[259]Chinese inspectors checking airline passengers for fevers, a common symptom of swine fluIn March 2013, the Chinese government reported three cases of H7N9 influenza infections in humans, two of whom had died and the third became critically ill. Although the strain of the virus is not thought to spread efficiently between humans,[286][287] by mid-April, at least 82 persons had become ill from H7N9, of which 17 had died. These cases include three small family clusters in Shanghai and one cluster between a neighboring girl and boy in Beijing, raising at least the possibility of human-to-human transmission. The WHO points out that one cluster did not have two of the cases lab confirmed and further points out, as a matter of baseline information, that some viruses are able to cause limited human-to-human transmission under conditions of close contact but are not transmissible enough to cause large community outbreaks.[288][289][290]Swine fluIn pigs swine influenza produces fever, lethargy, sneezing, coughing, difficulty breathing and decreased appetite.[291] In some cases the infection can cause abortion. Although mortality is usually low, the virus can produce weight loss and poor growth, causing economic loss to farmers.[291] Infected pigs can lose up to 12 pounds of body weight over a three- to four-week period.[291] Direct transmission of an influenza virus from pigs to humans is occasionally possible (this is called zoonotic swine flu). In all, 50 human cases are known to have occurred since the virus was identified in the mid-20th century, which have resulted in six deaths.[292]In 2009, a swine-origin H1N1 virus strain commonly referred to as \"swine flu\" caused the 2009 flu pandemic, but there is no evidence that it is endemic to pigs (i.e. actually a swine flu) or of transmission from pigs to people; instead, the virus spreads from person to person.[293][294] This strain is a reassortment of several strains of H1N1 that are usually found separately, in humans, birds, and pigs.[295]References^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}\"Influenza (Seasonal)\".

       "   'text': 'Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 1 (DEE1) is a seizure disorder characterized by a type of seizure known as infantile spasms. The spasms usually appear before the age of 1. Several types of spasms have been described, but the most commonly reported type involves bending at the waist and neck and extending the arms and legs (sometimes called a jackknife spasm). Each spasm lasts only seconds, but they occur in clusters several minutes long. Although individuals do not usually have spasms while they are sleeping, the spasms commonly occur just after awakening. Infantile spasms usually stop by age 5, but many children then develop other types of seizures that recur throughout their lives.Most babies with DEE1 have characteristic results on an electroencephalogram (EEG), a test used to measure the electrical activity of the brain. The EEG of these individuals typically shows an irregular pattern known as hypsarrhythmia, and this finding can help differentiate infantile spasms from other types of seizures.Early in life, babies with DEE1 stop developing normally and begin to lose skills they have acquired (developmental regression), such as sitting, rolling over, and babbling. Most affected individuals also have intellectual disability throughout their lives.FrequencyInfantile spasms are estimated to affect 1 to 1.6 in 100,000 individuals. This estimate includes DEE1 as well as infantile spasms that have other causes.CausesDEE1 is caused by mutations in the ARX gene. The protein produced from this gene plays a role in the normal functioning of the brain by regulating other genes that contribute to brain development. Research suggests that mutations in the ARX gene reduce the amount or function of the ARX protein. A shortage of ARX function is thought to disrupt normal brain development, leading to seizures and intellectual disability.It is likely that mutations in other genes that have not been identified cause rare cases of DEE1. Infantile spasms can also have nongenetic causes, such as brain malformations, other disorders that affect brain function, or brain damage. In addition, changes in genes that are not located on the X chromosome cause infantile spasms in rare cases.Learn more about the gene associated with Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 1ARXInheritance PatternDEE1 is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. The ARX gene is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation would usually have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. However, in some instances, one altered copy of the ARX gene is sufficient because the X chromosome with the normal copy of the ARX gene is turned off through a process called X-inactivation. Early in embryonic development in females, one of the two X chromosomes is permanently inactivated in somatic cells (cells other than egg and sperm cells). X-inactivation ensures that females, like males, have only one active copy of the X chromosome in each body cell.Usually X-inactivation occurs randomly, such that each X chromosome is active in about half of the body cells. Sometimes X-inactivation is not random, and one X chromosome is active in more than half of cells. When X-inactivation does not occur randomly, it is called skewed X-inactivation. Some ARX gene mutations may be associated with skewed X-inactivation, which results in the inactivation of the X chromosome with the normal copy of the ARX gene in most cells of the body. This skewed X-inactivation causes the chromosome with the mutated ARX gene to be expressed in more than half of cells, causing DEE1.A characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons.'},\n",

       "   'text': 'A number sign (#) is used with this entry because of evidence that susceptibility to acute infection-induced (herpes-specific) encephalopathy (IIAE5) is caused by heterozygous mutation in the TRAF3 gene (601896) on chromosome 14q32. One such patient has been reported.For a phenotypic description of herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) and a discussion of genetic heterogeneity of susceptibility to acute infection-induced encephalopathy, see 610551.Clinical FeaturesPerez de Diego et al. (2010) described a 4-year-old French girl from nonconsanguineous parents who presented with persistent high fever before the onset of other symptoms, including diarrhea and convulsions, followed by epilepsy and aphasia. Her cerebrospinal fluid contained herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1, and she responded well to 3 weeks of intravenous acyclovir treatment. At age 18 years, she was healthy and had normal responses to other infectious diseases, including other HSV family members.InheritanceIn the patient reported by Perez de Diego et al. (2010), susceptibility to HSE was inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.Molecular GeneticsIn a patient with susceptibility to HSE, Perez de Diego et al. (2010) identified a heterozygous C-to-T substitution at position 352 in exon 4 of the TRAF3 gene, resulting in a nonconservative missense change, arg118 to trp (R118W; 601896.0001).

For these patients, fever is usually diagnosed incidentally.[4]The most common complication (10-15% of children between 6 and 18 months) and most common cause of hospitalization in children with primary infection of HHV-6B is febrile seizures which can precipitate status epilepticus due to the sudden rise in body temperature.[5]Rash[edit]Once the febrile phase subsides, a rash develops. In some cases, the rash can present after one or two days after the fever resolves.[4] The rash is classically described as an erythematous morbilliform exanthem[3] and presents as a distribution of soft pink, discrete, and slightly raised lesions each with a 2-5mm diameter.[3][4][5] It classically begins on the trunk (torso) and spreads outward to the neck, extremities, and face. This pattern is referred to as a centrifugal spread.[3] Usually, peeling and itching are not characteristic of this rash.[4] This phase can last anywhere from several hours to 2 days.[3][4][5][6]Other symptoms[edit]A small percentage of children acquire HHV-6 with few signs or symptoms of the disease.[7] Children with HHV-6 infection can also present with miringitis (inflammation of the tympanic membranes),[3] upper respiratory symptoms,[5][8] diarrhea, and a bulging fontanelle.[5] In addition, children can experience pharyngitis with lymphoid hyperplasia seen on the soft palate and swelling of the eyelids.[4] These symptoms usually present during the febrile phase of roseola.[5] Cervical and postocciptal lymphadenopathy can also be seen, but this generally presents 2–4 days after the onset of the febrile phase.[5][9]In contrast, a child suffering from measles would usually appear sicker, with symptoms of conjunctivitis, cold-like symptoms, and a cough, and their rash would affect the face and last for several days. Liver dysfunction can occur in rare cases.[citation needed]In rare cases, HHV-6 can become active in an adult previously infected during childhood and can show signs of mononucleosis.[10]Cause[edit]Electron micrograph of HHV-6There are nine known human herpesviruses. Of these, roseola has been linked to two: human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) and human herpesvirus 7 (HHV-7), which are sometimes referred to collectively as Roseolovirus.[5] These viruses are of the Herpesviridae family and the Betaherpesvirinae subfamily, underwhich Cytomegalovirus is also classified.[5] HHV-6 has been further classified into HHV-6A and HHV-6B, two distinct viruses which share 88% of the same RNA makeup, with HHV-6B the most common cause of roseola.[3][11]After infection, these viruses enter a latent phase. Roseola caused by HHV-7 has been linked to the ability of HHV-7 infection to reactivate latent HHV-6.[5]Spread[edit]After exposure to roseola, the causative virus becomes latent in its host but is still present in saliva, skin, and lungs.[5] HHV-6 is thought to be transmitted from previously exposed or infected adults to young children by the shedding of virus through saliva.[7] Even so, most cases of roseola are transmitted without known exposure.[4]Diagnosis[edit]The diagnosis of roseola is made clinically based on the presence of the two phases: fever and rash.[4] Laboratory testing is seldom used as the results do not alter management of the disease.[5] An exception is in people who are immunocompromised in who serologic tests with viral identification can be used to confirm the diagnosis.[7]Roseola should be differentiated from other similar-appearing illnesses, such as rubella, measles, fifth disease, scarlet fever, and drug reactions. This differentiation may be determined based on symptoms.[7]Prevention[edit]Many viruses can cause Roseola and are shed by carriers without symptoms. Because of this and the fact that most children with the disease are not seriously ill, there is no particular method of prevention.[4] Proper hygienic measures, like regular handwashing, can be implemented as a routine method of prevention. Those who have been exposed or infected have been shown to shed the virus for the rest of their lives.[12] Because of this, there are no current guidelines regarding children staying home or away from child-care when infected.[12]There is no specific vaccine for HHV-6 or HHV-7.[citation needed]Treatment[edit]Most cases of HHV-6 infection improve on their own.[13] Because of this, supportive care is the mainstay treatment. The febrile phase can be managed using acetaminophen to control fever and prevent spikes in temperature which can lead to febrile seizures.[5][7] In the case of febrile seizures, medical advice should be sought, and treatment aggressively pursued.[4] Antiepileptic drugs are not recommended for patients who develop seizures from Roseola.[3] Once children have entered the rash phase, reassurance is important as this indicates resolution of the infection.[4]If encephalitis occurs in immunocompromised children, ganciclovir or foscarnet have inconsistently shown usefulness in treatment.[14] Treatment of children who are immunocompromised centers around decreasing their levels of immunosuppression as much as possible.[7]Prognosis[edit]Children infected with roseola generally have a good prognosis. Most recover without intervention and without long-term effects.[3][4]Epidemiology[edit]Between the two types of human herpesvirus 6, HHV-6B has been detected much more frequently in hosts.[11] HHV-6B has been shown to affect about 90% of children before the age of 3.[15] Out of these, 20% develop symptoms of roseola, also known as exanthem subitum.[15]Roseola affects girls and boys equally worldwide year-round.[4] Roseola typically affects children between six months and two years of age, with peak prevalence in children between 7 and 13 months old.[4][5] This correlates with the decrease in maternal antibodies, thus virus protection, that occurs at the age of 6 months.[5] Out of all emergency department visits for children between the ages of 6 months and 12 months who have fever, twenty percent of these are due to HHV-6.[5]Many children who have been exposed and infected can present without symptoms, which makes determining the incidence within the population difficult.[4]History[edit]John Zahorsky MD wrote extensively on this disease in the early 20th century, his first formal presentation was to the St Louis Pediatric society in 1909 where he described 15 young children with the illness. In a JAMA article published on Oct 18, 1913 he noted that \"the name \\'Roseola infantilis\\' had an important place in the medical terminology of writers on skin diseases\" but that descriptions of the disease by previous writers tended to confuse it with many other diseases that produce febrile rashes. In this JAMA article Zahorsky reports on 29 more children with Roseola and notes that the only condition that should seriously be considered in the differential diagnosis is German Measles (rubella) but notes that the fever of rubella only lasts a few hours whereas the prodromal fever of Roseola lasts three to five days and disappears with the formation of a morbilliform rash.[16]Names[edit]This section needs additional citations for verification.

Infants who are affected by the condition generally appear healthy with no suspicious signs and symptoms prior to the incident. It is the leading cause of death in infants age 1 to 12 months old. The exact underlying cause of SIDS is unknown; however, scientists suspect that it is likely a multifactorial condition (associated with the effects of multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors).

       "   'text': 'CLN10 disease is a severe disorder that primarily affects the nervous system. Individuals with this condition typically show signs and symptoms soon after birth. These signs and symptoms can include muscle rigidity, respiratory failure, and prolonged episodes of seizure activity that last several minutes (status epilepticus). It is likely that some affected individuals also have seizures before birth while in the womb. Infants with CLN10 disease have unusually small heads (microcephaly) with brains that may be less than half the normal size. There is a loss of brain cells in areas that coordinate movement (the cerebellum) and control thinking and emotions (the cerebral cortex). Nerve cells in the brain also lack a fatty substance called myelin, which protects them and promotes efficient transmission of nerve impulses. Infants with CLN10 disease often die hours to weeks after birth.In some individuals with CLN10 disease, the condition does not appear until later in life, between late infancy and adulthood. These individuals have a gradual loss of brain cells and often develop problems with balance and coordination (ataxia), loss of speech, a progressive loss in intellectual functioning (cognitive decline), and vision loss. Individuals with later-onset CLN10 disease have a shortened lifespan, depending on when their signs and symptoms first started.CLN10 disease is one of a group of disorders known as neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs). All of these disorders affect the nervous system and typically cause progressive problems with vision, movement, and thinking ability. The different NCLs are distinguished by their genetic cause. Each disease type is given the designation \"CLN,\" meaning ceroid lipofuscinosis, neuronal, and then a number to indicate its subtype.FrequencyThe prevalence of CLN10 disease is unknown; at least 11 cases have been described.CausesMutations in the CTSD gene cause CLN10 disease. The CTSD gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called cathepsin D. Cathepsin D is one of a family of cathepsin proteins that act as protease enzymes, which modify proteins by cutting them apart. Cathepsin D is found in many types of cells and is active in lysosomes, which are compartments within cells that digest and recycle different types of molecules. By cutting proteins apart, cathepsin D can break down certain proteins, turn on (activate) other proteins, and regulate self-destruction of the cell (apoptosis).CTSD gene mutations found to cause CLN10 disease that is present at birth lead to a complete lack of cathepsin D enzyme activity. As a result, proteins and fats are not broken down properly and abnormally accumulate within lysosomes. While accumulations of these substances occurs in cells throughout the body, nerve cells appear to be particularly vulnerable to damage caused by the abnormal cell materials. Early and widespread loss of nerve cells in CLN10 disease leads to severe signs and symptoms and death in infancy.In the later-onset cases of CLN10 disease, CTSD gene mutations likely result in the production of a cathepsin D enzyme whose function is greatly reduced but not eliminated. As a result, some proteins and fats are broken down by the enzyme, so it takes longer for these substances to accumulate in lysosomes and cause nerve cell death.Learn more about the gene associated with CLN10 diseaseCTSDInheritance PatternThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.'},\n",

       "   'text': 'Rett syndrome is a progressive, neuro-developmental condition that primarily affects girls. Affected girls appear to have normal psychomotor development during the first 6 to 18 months of life, followed by a developmental \"plateau,\" and then rapid regression in language and motor skills. Additional signs and symptoms may include repetitive, stereotypic hand movements; fits of screaming and inconsolable crying; autistic features; panic-like attacks; teeth grinding (bruxism); episodic apnea and/or hyperpnea; gait ataxia and apraxia; tremors; seizures; and slowed head growth. Some people have an atypical form of Rett syndrome that may be more mild or more severe. Classic Rett syndrome is most commonly caused by mutations in the MECP2 gene and is usually inherited in an X-linked dominant manner. The vast majority of cases are not inherited from a parent, but are due to a new mutation in the affected person. Treatment mainly focuses on the specific signs and symptoms of the condition.'},\n",

       "   'text': 'Abortion in Paraguay is illegal except in case of the threat to the life of the woman.[1] Anyone who performs an abortion can be sentenced to 15 to 30 months in prison. If the abortion is done without the consent of the woman, the punishment is increased to 2 to 5 years. If the death of the woman occurred as a result of the abortion, the person who did the procedure can be sentenced to 4 to 6 years in prison, and 5 to 10 years in cases in which she did not consent.[1]In Paraguay, 23 out of 100 deaths of young women are the result of illegal abortions.[2] Concerning this death rate, Paraguay has one of the highest in the region.[2]In April 2015, a story about a 10-year-old Paraguayan girl who was 22 weeks pregnant as a result of having allegedly been raped and impregnated by her stepfather came to light.[3] The pregnancy had been discovered that same month upon the girl’s mother having brought her to a local hospital in order to receive medical treatment for abdominal pain, which was found to have been related to the pregnancy. Calls from her mother as well as outraged members of the public throughout the world for permission to allow the girl the ability to undergo an abortion procedure were ultimately denied. The girl had given birth to the child via a caesarean section in a Red Cross hospital in Paraguay’s capital city of Asunción later that year.[3] The girl’s stepfather has since been prosecuted for the rape and her mother had also been charged with negligence for her alleged role in the circumstances surrounding the rape and pregnancy of her daughter. The high-profile nature of this case has led opposition leftist parties to push for less restrictive abortion laws in Paraguay, such as in cases of child pregnancies and in cases of sexual assault.[3] The United Nations has found that the maternal death rate is four times higher for girls under the age of 16 in Latin America.[3] The 10-year-old girl has reportedly survived the birth, and her mother and grandmother have both requested legal custody of the newborn child.[3]See also[edit]AbortionAbortion by countryAbortion lawDomestic violence in ParaguayHealth in ParaguayWomen in ParaguayReferences[edit]^ a b https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/abortion/doc/paraguay.doc^ a b .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}\"Archived copy\".

Some patients may also suffer from a headache and visual issues. These symptoms may also become more severe at night.[8][9][10][11][12] As the condition progresses and worsens, a spontaneous hematoma occurs following the rupture of the liver capsule, which occurs more frequently in the right lobe. The presence of any combinations of these symptoms, subcapsular liver hematoma in particular, warrants an immediate check-up due to the high morbidity and mortality rates of this condition.[13][14][15]Risk factors[edit]Elevated body mass index and metabolic disorders, as well as antiphospholipid syndrome, significantly increase the risk of HELLP syndrome in all female patients. Females who have had or are related to a female with previous HELLP syndrome complications tend to be at a higher risk in all their subsequent pregnancies.[16][17][18]The risk of HELLP syndrome is not conclusively associated with a specific genetic variation, but likely a combination of genetic variations, such as FAS gene, VEGF gene, glucocorticoid receptor gene and the tol-like receptor gene, increase the risk.[17][19][20][21][22]Pathophysiology[edit]The pathophysiology is still unclear and an exact cause is yet to be found. However, it shares a common mechanism, which is endothelial cell injury, with other conditions, such as acute kidney injury and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.[23][24] Increasing the understanding of HELLP syndrome\\'s pathophysiology will enhance diagnostic accuracy, especially in the early stages. This will lead to advancements in the prevention, management, and treatment of the condition, which will increase the likelihood of both maternal and fetal survival and recovery.[6][25]Inflammation and coagulation[edit]As a result of endothelial cell injury, a cascade of pathological reactions manifests and become increasingly severe and even fatal as signs and symptoms progress. Following endothelial injury, vasospasms and platelet activation occur alongside the decreased release of the endothelium-derived relaxing factor and increased the release of von Willebrand factor (vWF), leading to general activation of the coagulation cascade and inflammation. Placental components, such as inflammatory cytokines and syncytiotrophoblast particles interact with the maternal immune system and endothelial cells, further promoting coagulation and inflammation.[26][27] These interactions also elevate leukocyte numbers and interleukin concentrations, as well as increase complement activity.[28][29]Low platelet count[edit]vWF degradation in HELLP syndrome is inhibited due to decreased levels of degrading proteins, leading to an increased exposure of platelets to vWF. As a result, thrombotic microangiopathies develop and lead to thrombocytopenia.[30]Blood breakdown[edit]As a result of the high number of angiopathies, the erythrocytes fragment as they pass through the blood vessels with damaged endothelium and large fibrin networks, leading to macroangiopathic haemolytic anaemia. As a consequence of hemolysis, lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) and hemoglobin are released, with the latter binding to serum bilirubin or haptoglobin.[8][16]Liver[edit]During the coagulation cascade, fibrin is deposited in the liver and leads to hepatic sinusoidal obstruction and vascular congestion, which increase intrahepatic pressure. Placenta-derived FasL (CD95L), which is toxic to human hepatocytes, leads to hepatocyte apoptosis and necrosis by inducing the expression of TNFα and results in the release of liver enzymes. Hepatic damages are worsened by the disrupted portal and total hepatic blood flow that result as a consequence of the microangiopathies. Collectively, widespread endothelial dysfunction and hepatocellular damage result in global hepatic dysfunction often leading to liver necrosis, haemorrhages, and capsular rupture.[31][32][33]Diagnosis[edit]Early and accurate diagnosis, which relies on laboratory tests and imaging exams, is essential for treatment and management and significantly reduces the morbidity rate. However, diagnosis of the syndrome is challenging, especially due to the variability in the signs and symptoms and the lack of consensus amongst healthcare professionals. Similarities to other conditions, as well as normal pregnancy features, commonly lead to misdiagnosed cases or more often, delayed diagnosis.[6][25]There is a general consensus regarding the main three diagnostic criteria of HELLP syndrome, which include hepatic dysfunction, thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia in patients suspected to have preeclampsia. A blood smear will often exhibit abnormalities, such as schistocytes, bur cells, and helmet cells, which indicate erythrocyte damage.[citation needed]Thrombocytopenia, which is the earliest coagulopathy present in all HELLP syndrome patients, is indicated by low platelet count (below 100 x 109 L-1) or by testing the levels of fibrin metabolites and antithrombin III.Elevated serum levels of certain proteins, in particular, LDH, alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST), are indicative of hepatic dysfunction. Extremely high serum levels of these proteins, specifically LDH levels > 1,400 IU/L, AST levels > 150 IU/L and ALT levels > 100 IU/L, significantly elevate the risk of maternal mortality.[31][2][8][9][23][32][34][35][36][37][excessive citations]A number of other, but less conclusive, clinical diagnostic criteria are also used in diagnosis alongside the main clinical diagnostic criteria for HELLP syndrome. De novo manifestation of hypertension with systolic pressure and diastolic pressure above 160mmHg and 110 mmHg, respectively.Proteinuria, leucocytosis and elevated uric acid concentrations > 7.8mg.Decreased serum haptoglobin and haemoglobin levels.Increased serum bilirubin levels and visual disturbances.[38][39]Imaging tests, such as ultrasound, tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are instrumental in the correct diagnosis of HELLP syndrome in patients with suspected liver dysfunction. Unurgent cases must undergo MRI, but laboratory tests, such as glucose determination, are more encouraged in mild cases of HELLP syndrome.[31][40]Classification[edit]A classification system, which was developed in Mississippi, measures the severity of the syndrome using the lowest observed platelet count in the patients alongside the appearance of the other two main clinical criteria. Class I is the most severe, with a relatively high risk of morbidity and mortality, compared to the other two classes.[41]Class I HELLP syndrome is characterised by a platelet count below 50,000/µL.Class II HELLP syndrome is characterised by a platelet count of 50,000-100,000/µL.Class III HELLP syndrome is characterised by a platelet count of 100,000-150,000/µL.Another classification system, introduced in Memphis, categorises HELLP syndrome based on its expression.Partial expression of the condition is characterised by the manifestation of one or two of the main diagnostic criteria.The complete expression of the condition is characterised by the manifestation of all three main diagnostic criteria.[42]Treatment[edit]The only current recommended and most effective treatment is delivery of the baby, as the signs and symptoms diminish and gradually disappear following the delivery of the placenta. Prompt delivery is the only viable option in cases with multiorgan dysfunction or multiorgan failure, haemorrhage and considerable danger to the fetus. Certain medications are also used to target and alleviate specific symptoms.[31][2][43][44]Corticosteroids are of unclear benefit, though there is tentative evidence that they can increase the mother\\'s platelet count.[45][46]Prognosis[edit]With treatment, maternal mortality is about 1 percent, although complications such as placental abruption, acute kidney injury, subcapsular liver hematoma, permanent liver damage, and retinal detachment occur in about 25% of women. Perinatal mortality (stillbirths plus death in infancy) is between 73 and 119 per 1000 babies of woman with HELLP, while up to 40% are small for gestational age.[47] In general, however, factors such as gestational age are more important than the severity of HELLP in determining the outcome in the baby.[48]Epidemiology[edit]HELLP syndrome affects 10-20% of pre-eclampsia patients and is a complication in 0.5-0.9% of all pregnancies.[6][49] Caucasian women over 25 years of age comprise most of the diagnosed HELLP syndrome cases.[50] In 70% of cases before childbirth, the condition manifests in the third trimester, but 10% and 20% of the cases exhibit symptoms before and after the third trimester, respectively. Postpartum occurrences are also observed in 30% of all HELLP syndrome cases.[51]History[edit]HELLP syndrome was identified as a distinct clinical entity (as opposed to severe pre-eclampsia) by Dr. Louis Weinstein in 1982.[31] In a 2005 article, Weinstein wrote that the unexplained postpartum death of a woman who had haemolysis, abnormal liver function, thrombocytopenia, and hypoglycemia motivated him to review the medical literature and to compile information on similar women.[10] He noted that cases with features of HELLP had been reported as early as 1954.[10][52]See also[edit]Acute fatty liver of pregnancyHypertrophic decidual vasculopathyReferences[edit]^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}\"HELLP syndrome\".

       "   'text': 'Jamaican vomiting sicknessSpecialtyToxicologyJamaican vomiting sickness (also known as toxic hypoglycemic syndrome (THS),[1] acute ackee fruit intoxication,[2] or ackee poisoning[1]) is an acute illness caused by the toxins hypoglycin A and hypoglycin B, which are present in fruit of the ackee tree.While in the fully ripened arils, hypoglycin A is at levels of less than 0.1 ppm, in unripe arils it can be over 1000 ppm;[3] and cause vomiting and even death. Some countries in the Caribbean and Western Africa experience frequent cases.[4]Contents1 Presentation2 Pathophysiology3 Diagnosis4 In popular culture5 ReferencesPresentation[edit]Abdominal discomfort begins two to six hours after eating unripe ackee fruit, followed by sudden onset vomiting. In severe cases, profound dehydration, seizures, coma, and death may ensue.Children and those who are malnourished are more susceptible to the disease.[3]Pathophysiology[edit]When ingested, hypoglycin A is metabolized to produce methylenecyclopropylacetic acid (MCPA). MCPA acts to inhibit the beta-oxidation of fatty acids in two ways.First, it interferes with the transport of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria.Also, it inhibits acyl-CoA dehydrogenases, so that only unsaturated fatty acids can be fully oxidized.Fatty acids accumulate in the liver in a microvesicular pattern that can be seen on biopsy. In the absence of fatty acid metabolism, the body becomes dependent on glucose and glycogen for energy. Octreotide can be used to reduce secretion of insulin by the pancreas, thereby preventing severe hypoglycemia.[3]Inhibition of beta-oxidation of fatty acids, however, also depletes a necessary cofactor for gluconeogenesis.Once the liver glycogen stores are depleted, the body cannot synthesize glucose, and severe hypoglycemia results.[3]A similar outbreak of lethal hypoglycemic encephalopathy has been linked to consumption of lychee fruit in Muzaffarpur, India. Urinalysis of children affected by the disease has shown all affected have elevated levels of hypoglycin suggesting the same underlying pathophysiology as Jamaican vomiting sickness.[5]Diagnosis[edit]This section is empty.

       "   'text': \"Ménière disease is a disorder of the inner ear that affects balance and hearing. This condition is characterized by sudden episodes of extreme dizziness (vertigo), a roaring sound in the ears (tinnitus), a feeling of pressure or fullness in the ears, and fluctuations in hearing. Episodes are often associated with nausea and vomiting, and they can severely disrupt activities of daily living.The episodes associated with Ménière disease generally last several hours. Studies suggest that episodes can be triggered by stress, tiredness (fatigue), emotional upset, illness, and dietary factors. The timing of these episodes is unpredictable; affected individuals may experience a cluster of episodes within a short period, followed by months or years without any symptoms.Ménière disease usually appears in adulthood, most often in a person's 40s or 50s. It is much less common in children and young adults. The symptoms of the disorder typically begin in one ear, although they may later involve both ears.Some people with Ménière disease have no symptoms of the disorder between episodes, particularly in the early stages of the disease. Over time, however, many affected individuals develop ongoing problems with unsteadiness, tinnitus, and a feeling of fullness in the ears. Additionally, permanent hearing loss eventually develops in many people with this disorder.FrequencyThe prevalence of Ménière disease varies in different geographic regions and ethnic groups. It appears to be more common in people of European descent than in those with other backgrounds. In the United States, there are an estimated 615,000 people with Ménière disease, and more than 45,000 new cases are diagnosed each year.CausesThe cause of Ménière disease is unknown, although it probably results from a combination of environmental and genetic factors.Ménière disease is thought to be related to abnormalities of the inner ear, which contains structures that are needed for normal hearing and balance. Episodes of vertigo, tinnitus, and hearing loss likely result from fluctuating amounts of fluid in the inner ear. These changes disrupt signals sent from the inner ear to the brain that are related to sound and the body's position and movement.Researchers have studied many possible risk factors for Ménière disease, including viral infections, trauma to the inner ear, noise pollution, allergies, abnormal immune system responses, and migraines. Studies have also examined changes in more than a dozen genes that might contribute to the signs and symptoms of this condition. However, none of the factors studied so far appears to play a major role in Ménière disease. Researchers are looking for additional environmental and genetic factors that are associated with this complex disorder.Inheritance PatternMost cases of Ménière disease are sporadic, which means they occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. A small percentage of all cases have been reported to run in families.When the disorder is familial, it most often has an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Autosomal dominant inheritance means one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase the risk of the disorder. However, no associated genes have been identified.\"},\n",

       "   'text': 'EpidemicThe Tanganyika laughter epidemic of 1962 was an outbreak of mass hysteria– or mass psychogenic illness (MPI)– rumored to have occurred in or near the village of Kashasha on the western coast of Lake Victoria in Tanganyika (which, once united with Zanzibar, became the modern nation of Tanzania) near the border with Uganda.[1]Contents1 History2 Causes3 See also4 References5 External linksHistory[edit]The laughter epidemic began on January 30, 1962, at a mission-run boarding school for girls in Kashasha. It started with three girls and spread throughout the school, affecting 95 of the 159 pupils, aged 12–18.[2][3] Symptoms lasted from a few hours to 16 days. The teaching staff were unaffected and reported that students were unable to concentrate on their lessons. The school closed on March 18.[4]The epidemic spread to Nshamba, a village where several of the girls lived.[4] In April and May, 217 mostly young villagers had laughing attacks. The Kashasha school reopened on May 21, and reclosed at the end of June. Earlier that month, the laughing epidemic spread to Ramashenye girls\\' middle school, near Bukoba, affecting 48 girls.[2]The Kashasha school was sued for allowing the children and their parents to transmit it to the surrounding area. Other schools, Kashasha itself, and another village were affected to some degree.[4] Eighteen months after it started, the phenomenon died off. The laughter reports were widely accompanied by descriptions of fainting, flatulence, respiratory problems, rashes, crying and screaming.[5]In all, 14 schools were shut down and 1000 people were affected.[6]Causes[edit]Christian F. Hempelmann, then of Purdue University, has theorized that the episode was stress-induced.In 1962, Tanganyika had just won its independence, he said,and students had reported feeling stressed because of higher expectations by teachers and parents.MPI, he says, usually occurs in people without a lot of power.\"MPI is a last resort for people of a low status.It\\'s an easy way for them to express that something is wrong.\"[5][7]Sociologist Robert Bartholomew and psychiatrist Simon Wessely both put forward a culture-specific epidemic hysteria hypothesis, pointing out that the occurrences in 1960s Africa were prevalent in missionary schools and Tanganyikan society was ruled by strict traditional elders, so the likelihood is the hysteria was a manifestation of the cultural dissonance between the “traditional conservatism” at home and the new ideas challenging those beliefs in school, which they termed ‘conversion reactions’.[8]See also[edit]List of mass hysteria casesDancing maniaReferences[edit]^ .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}Jeffries, Stuart (November 21, 2007). \"The outbreak of hysteria that\\'s no fun at all\".

       "   'title': 'Tyrosinemia Type I',\n",
       "   'text': 'SummaryClinical characteristics.Untreated tyrosinemia type I usually presents either in young infants with severe liver involvement or later in the first year with liver dysfunction and renal tubular dysfunction associated with growth failure and rickets. Untreated children may have repeated, often unrecognized, neurologic crises lasting one to seven days that can include change in mental status, abdominal pain, peripheral neuropathy, and/or respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Death in the untreated child usually occurs before age ten years, typically from liver failure, neurologic crisis, or hepatocellular carcinoma. Combined treatment with nitisinone and a low-tyrosine diet has resulted in a greater than 90% survival rate, normal growth, improved liver function, prevention of cirrhosis, correction of renal tubular acidosis, and improvement in secondary rickets.Diagnosis/testing.Tyrosinemia type I results from deficiency of the enzyme fumarylacetoacetase (FAH). The diagnosis is established in a proband with typical biochemical findings (increased succinylacetone concentration in the blood and urine; elevated plasma concentrations of tyrosine, methionine, and phenylalanine; and elevated urinary concentration of tyrosine metabolites and the compound δ-ALA) and/or by the identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in FAH on molecular genetic testing.Management.Treatment of manifestations: Nitisinone (Orfadin®), 2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoro-methylbenzyol)-1,3 cyclohexanedione (NTBC), which blocks parahydroxyphenylpyruvic acid dioxygenase (p-HPPD), the second step in the tyrosine degradation pathway, prevents the accumulation of fumarylacetoacetate and its conversion to succinylacetone. Nitisinone treatment should begin as soon as the diagnosis of tyrosinemia type I is confirmed. Because nitisinone increases the blood concentration of tyrosine, dietary management with controlled intake of phenylalanine and tyrosine should be started immediately after diagnosis to prevent tyrosine crystals from forming in the cornea. If the blood concentration of phenylalanine becomes too low (<20 μmol/L), additional natural protein should be added to the diet. Prior to the availability of nitisinone, the only definitive therapy for tyrosinemia type I was liver transplantation, which now should be reserved for those children who have severe liver failure at presentation and fail to respond to nitisinone therapy or have documented evidence of malignant changes in hepatic tissue.Prevention of primary manifestations: Initiation of treatment with nitisinone as soon as the diagnosis is confirmed.Prevention of secondary complications: Treatment of early signs of carnitine deficiency, osteoporosis, and rickets that are secondary to renal tubular Fanconi syndrome.Surveillance: Guidelines for routine surveillance of individuals with tyrosinemia type I have been established.Agents/circumstances to avoid: Inappropriate protein intake.Evaluation of relatives at risk: All subsequent children of the parents of a child with tyrosinemia type I should have urine and blood succinylacetone analyzed as soon as possible after birth to enable the earliest possible diagnosis and initiation of therapy. If the pathogenic variants in the family are known, prenatal molecular genetic testing of an at-risk pregnancy may be considered.Pregnancy management: Little data exist on the use of nitisinone during human pregnancy; however, at least two women have given birth to healthy infants while receiving therapeutic doses of nitisinone.Genetic counseling.Tyrosinemia type I is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if both pathogenic variants in a family are known.DiagnosisTyrosinemia type I is caused by deficiency of the enzyme fumarylacetoacetase (FAH) (EC 3.7.1.2) (see Figure 1 and Pathophysiology).Figure 1. The tyrosine catabolic pathway Suggestive FindingsTyrosinemia type I should be suspected in individuals with the following newborn screening results, clinical features, and supportive laboratory findings.Newborn screeningPresence of succinylacetone, measured directly from the newborn blood spot by tandem mass spectroscopy, is pathognomonic for tyrosinemia type 1.Elevated tyrosine or methionine concentration in the blood suggests liver disease, which can be from a variety of causes; the diagnosis of tyrosinemia type I should be further evaluated by quantification of plasma or urinary succinylacetone.Infants with tyrosinemia type I may have only modestly elevated or normal blood concentrations of tyrosine and methionine when the first newborn screening sample is collected.Elevated tyrosine concentration on newborn screening can be the result of transient tyrosinemia of the newborn, tyrosinemia type II or III, or other liver disease.Elevated methionine concentration can indicate liver dysfunction, defects in methionine metabolism, or homocystinuria (see Homocystinuria Caused by Cystathionine Beta-Synthetase Deficiency).Low delta-ALA-dehydratase (PBG synthase) enzyme activity. This is measured in the newborn screening program in Quebec, Canada [Giguère et al 2005]. Succinylacetone is then measured in the urine of infants with apparent δ-ALA dehydratase deficiency [Schulze et al 2001].Clinical features (in untreated individuals)Severe liver disease in young infantsSigns of renal disease, rickets, and/or neurologic crises in children older than age six monthsUntreated children may have repeated neurologic crises lasting one to seven days that can include change in mental status, abdominal pain, peripheral neuropathy, and/or respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation.Supportive laboratory findingsIncreased succinylacetone concentration in the blood and excretion in the urineNote: (1) Increased excretion of succinylacetone in the urine of a child with liver failure or severe renal disease is a pathognomonic sign of tyrosinemia type I. (2) Many laboratories require that measurement of succinylacetone be specifically requested when ordering urine organic acids.Elevated plasma concentration of tyrosine, methionine, and phenylalanineNote: (1) Plasma tyrosine concentration in affected infants can be normal in cord blood and during the newborn period. (2) Elevated plasma tyrosine concentration can also be a nonspecific indicator of liver damage or immaturity; for example, in infants taking a high-protein formula [Techakittiroj et al 2005], including undiluted goat\\'s milk [Hendriksz & Walter 2004].Elevated urinary concentration of tyrosine metabolitesp-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, p-hydroxyphenyllactate, and p-hydroxyphenylacetate detected on urine organic acid testingIncreased urinary excretion of the compound δ-ALA secondary to inhibition of the enzyme δ-ALA dehydratase by succinylacetone in the liver and circulating red blood cells [Sassa & Kappas 1983]Changes in liver function (in untreated tyrosinemia type 1)Markedly elevated serum concentration of alpha-fetoprotein (average 160,000 ng/mL) (normal: <1,000 ng/mL for infants age 1-3 months; <12 ng/mL for children age 3 months to 18 years)Prolonged prothrombin and partial thromboplastin timesNote: (1) Changes in serum concentration of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and prothrombin time / partial thromboplastin time (PT/PTT) are more severe in tyrosinemia type I than in nonspecific liver disease and are often the presenting findings in tyrosinemia type I. (2) Transaminases and bilirubin are only modestly elevated, if at all. (3) An individual with liver disease and normal serum concentration of AFP and normal PT/PTT has a low probability of having tyrosinemia type I.Establishing the DiagnosisThe diagnosis of tyrosinemia type I is established in a proband with characteristic biochemical findings (increased succinylacetone concentration in the blood and urine; elevated plasma concentrations of tyrosine, methionine, and phenylalanine; and elevated urinary concentration of tyrosine metabolites and the compound δ-ALA) and/or by the identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in FAH on molecular genetic testing (see Table 1).Molecular Genetic TestingSingle-gene testing. Sequence analysis of FAH is performed first and followed by gene-targeted deletion/duplication analysis if only one or no pathogenic variant is found.Targeted analysis for the p.Pro261Leu pathogenic variant can be performed first in individuals of Ashkenzai Jewish ancestry; this variant accounts for more than 99% of the pathogenic variants in this population [Elpeleg et al 2002].The pathogenic variant c.1062+5G>A (IVS12+5 G>A) accounts for 87.9% of pathogenic variants in the French Canadian population [Poudrier et al 1996].The four common FAH pathogenic variants – c.1062+5G>A (IVS12+5 G>A), c.554-1G>T (IVS6-1 G>T), c.607-6T>G (IVS7-6 T>G), and p.Pro261Leu – account for approximately 60% of pathogenic variants in tyrosinemia type I in the general US population [CR Scott, unpublished data].Table 1.

Methods used may include quantitative PCR, long-range PCR, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), and a gene-targeted microarray designed to detect single-exon deletions or duplications.5. Park et al [2009] reported a large deletion involving FAH.Clinical CharacteristicsClinical DescriptionFor children who were not detected by newborn screening, tyrosinemia type I usually presents either in young infants with severe liver involvement or later in the first year with liver dysfunction and significant renal involvement, growth failure, and rickets. Growth failure results from chronic illness with poor nutritional intake, liver involvement, and/or chronic renal disease. Death in the undetected or untreated child usually occurs before age ten years, typically from liver failure, neurologic crisis, or hepatocellular carcinoma.Liver involvement. Undetected or untreated children presenting before age six months typically have acute liver failure with initial loss of synthetic function for clotting factors. PT and PTT are markedly prolonged and not corrected by vitamin K supplementation; factor II, VII, IX, XI, and XII levels are decreased; factor V and factor VIII levels are preserved. Paradoxically, serum transaminase levels may be only modestly elevated; serum bilirubin concentration may be normal or only slightly elevated, in contrast to most forms of severe liver disease in which marked elevation of transaminases and serum bilirubin concentration occur concomitantly with prolongation of PT and PTT. Resistance of affected liver cells to cell death may explain the observed discrepancy in liver function [Vogel et al 2004].This early phase can progress to liver failure with ascites, jaundice, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Children may have a characteristic odor of \"boiled cabbage\" or \"rotten mushrooms.\" Infants occasionally have persistent hypoglycemia; some have hyperinsulinism [Baumann et al 2005]. Others have chronic low-grade acidosis [CR Scott, unpublished data]. Untreated affected infants may die from liver failure within weeks or months of first symptoms [Hegarty et al 2015].Renal tubular involvement. In the more chronic form of the untreated disorder, symptoms develop after age six months; renal tubular involvement is the major manifestation. The renal tubular dysfunction involves a Fanconi-like renal syndrome with generalized aminoaciduria, phosphate loss, and, for many, renal tubular acidosis. The continued renal loss of phosphate is believed to account for rickets; serum calcium concentrations are usually normal.Neurologic crises. Untreated children may have repeated neurologic crises similar to those seen in older individuals with acute intermittent porphyria. These crises include change in mental status, abdominal pain, peripheral neuropathy, and/or respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Crises can last one to seven days. Repeated neurologic crises often go unrecognized:Mitchell et al [1990] reported that 42% of untreated French Canadian children with tyrosinemia type I had experienced such episodes.In an international survey, van Spronsen et al [1994] reported that 10% of deaths in untreated children occurred during a neurologic crisis.Hepatocellular carcinoma. Those children who are not treated with nitisinone and a low-tyrosine diet and who survive the acute onset of liver failure are at high risk of developing and succumbing to hepatocellular carcinoma.Survival in untreated children. Untreated infants diagnosed before age two months had a two-year survival rate of 29% [van Spronsen et al 1994].Those diagnosed between ages two and six months had a 74% two-year survival rate; those diagnosed after age six months had a 96% two-year survival rate.After more than five years the survival rate of the group diagnosed between ages two and six months dropped to approximately 30% and that of the group diagnosed after age six months dropped to approximately 60% (Figure 2).Figure 2. Survival of children with tyrosinemia before 1992 [van Spronsen et al 1994] Treated tyrosinemia type I. The natural history in children who are treated with nitisinone is different from that in untreated children. Affected children younger than age two years who are treated with a combination of nitisinone and low-tyrosine diet are markedly improved compared to those children treated with low-tyrosine diet alone. The combined nitisinone and low-tyrosine diet treatment has resulted in a greater than 90% survival rate, normal growth, improved liver function, prevention of cirrhosis, correction of renal tubular acidosis, and improvement in secondary rickets [McKiernan 2006, Masurel-Paulet et al 2008, Larochelle et al 2012].Neurologic crises observed in treated children have always been associated with a prolonged interruption in nitisinone treatment [CR Scott, unpublished data].Children with acute liver failure require support prior to and during the initiation of treatment with nitisinone. Improvement generally occurs within one week of starting nitisinone treatment.Corneal crystals. Nitisinone blocks the tyrosine catabolic pathway such that succinylacetone is not produced but tissue tyrosine levels are raised. Blood tyrosine concentration greater than 600 mol/L confers risk of precipitation of tyrosine as bilateral, linear, branching subepithelial corneal opacities [Ahmad et al 2002], causing photophobia and itchy, sensitive eyes. The crystals resolve once tyrosine levels are reduced.Hepatocellular carcinoma. Although Holme & Lindstedt [2000] and van Spronsen et al [2005] reported hepatocellular carcinoma in individuals after years of nitisinone therapy, it is estimated that fewer than 5% of children placed on nitisinone therapy before age two years develop hepatocellular carcinoma by age ten years [Larochelle et al 2012].In Quebec, where tyrosinemia type I is included in the newborn screening program, no affected individuals have been hospitalized for manifestations of tyrosinemia type I, and hepatocellular carcinoma has not been reported in individuals who were placed on nitisinone therapy prior to age 30 days. The longest period of treatment reported in this group is 12 years [Larochelle et al 2012].PathophysiologyFumarylacetoacetase (FAH) is the terminal enzyme in the tyrosine catabolic pathway (Figure 1). In FAH deficiency, fumarylacetoacetate (FAA), the immediate precursor:Appears to accumulate in hepatocytes, causing cellular damage and apoptosis (identified in an animal model by Endo & Sun [2002]);Is diverted into succinylacetoacetate and succinylacetone. Succinylacetone interferes with the activity of the following hepatic enzymes:Parahydroxyphenylpyruvic acid dioxygenase (p-HPPD), resulting in elevation of plasma tyrosine concentration;PBG synthase, resulting in (1) reduced activity of the enzyme δ-ALA dehydratase in liver and circulating red blood cells; (2) reduced heme synthesis; (3) increased δ-aminolevulinic acid (δ-ALA), which may induce acute neurologic episodes; and (4) increased urinary excretion of δ-ALA.Genotype-Phenotype CorrelationsIn general, no correlation is observed between clinical presentation and genotype. Acute and chronic forms have been seen in the same families, as well as in unrelated individuals with the same genotype [Poudrier et al 1998].One mechanism that explains this clinical variation is gene reversion. Hepatic nodules removed from livers of individuals with the chronic form of tyrosinemia type I have been shown to have cells that are immunologically positive for FAH protein and to have enzymatic activity for FAH [Kvittingen et al 1994, Grompe 2001]. These seemingly \"normal\" cells appear to have arisen by gene reversion – that is, the spontaneous self-correction (i.e., reversion or \"back-mutation\") of the germline pathogenic variant to the normal gene sequence during somatic cell division.Spontaneous somatic variants that suppress the effects of the pathogenic variants and allow for normal or near-normal gene expression in these cells have also been reported [Bliksrud et al 2005]. This is a true reversion of the mutated sequence and not the result of maternal cell colonization or maternal cell fusion [Bergeron et al 2004]. The \"normal\" (i.e., reverted) cells have a selective growth advantage because they are no longer at risk for apoptosis from the accumulation of FAA. These foci of revertant \"normal\" cell colonies comprise many of the liver nodules in untreated individuals with chronic tyrosinemia type I who have a milder biochemical and clinical phenotype [Kim et al 2000, Demers et al 2003]. However, the continued production of FAA by the non-revertant mutated cells places the individual at continued risk for hepatocellular carcinoma [Kim et al 2000].A rare and atypical form of tyrosinemia type I has been reported in a four-month-old Belgian infant with severe liver disease. Liver function studies were abnormal with markedly elevated alpha-fetoprotein, prolonged PT and PTT, and undetectable succinylacetone in urine. Fumarylacetoacetase (FAH) protein and activity was decreased, but not absent. Homozygosity for a unique pathogenic variant, c.103G>A (p.Ala35Thr), was identified [Cassiman et al 2009].Similarly, three sibs who developed chronic liver disease and HCC without detectable blood or urine succinylacetone had deficient FAH activity. The family was of Middle Eastern background and each child was homozygous for c.424A>G in FAH [Blackburn et al 2016].NomenclatureThe term \" tyrosinosis\" was previously used to refer to tyrosinemia type I include tyrosinosis.PrevalenceIn geographic areas without newborn screening, tyrosinemia type I affects approximately one in 100,000 to 120,000 births [Mitchell et al 2001]. Because of the inconsistent and confusing nature of its clinical presentation, it is estimated that fewer than 50% of affected individuals are diagnosed while alive.In the general US population, the carrier frequency is estimated at 1:150 to 1:100.Two regions of the world have a higher than expected frequency of tyrosinemia type I due to the increased frequency of certain pathogenic variants resulting from a founder effect:In the Scandanavian countries (c.1062+5G>A (IVS 12+5 G>A), p.Gly337Ser, and/or p.249HisfsTer5.5) and in Finland (p.Trp262Ter), the birth prevalence is estimated at 1:74,000 and 1:60,000 live births, respectively [Bliksrud et al 2012].A founder effect from colonization by French settlers is present in the province of Quebec, Canada. The c.1062+5G>A (IVS12+5 G>A) pathogenic variant accounts for 87% of allelic variants in this population. The birth prevalence in the province of Quebec is 1:16,000. In the Saguenay-Lac Saint-Jean region of Quebec, it is 1:1,846 live births. The overall carrier frequency in Quebec is 1:66 based on newborn screening data. The carrier frequency in the Saguenay-Lac St-Jean region is 1:16-1:20.Differential DiagnosisChildren with any of the following presenting findings should be evaluated for tyrosinemia type I (Table 2):Table 2.

Techakittiroj et al [2005]2. Undiluted goat\\'s milk [Hendriksz & Walter 2004]3. Bansal & Dhawan [2004]Tyrosinemia type II is caused by a defect in tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) (EC 2.6.1.5). Establishing the diagnosis of tyrosinemia type II relies on the following:Plasma tyrosine concentration typically greater than 500 µmol/L that may exceed 1,000 µmol/L (The concentration of other amino acids is normal.)Increased excretion of p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, p-hydroxyphenyllactate, and p-hydroxyphenylacetate and presence of small quantities of N-acetyltyrosine and 4-tyramine on urine organic acid analysisAffected individuals have painful, non-pruritic, and hyperkeratotic plaques on the soles and palms. The plantar surface of the digits may show marked yellowish thickening associated with the hyperkeratosis. Ophthalmologic involvement is recalcitrant pseudodendritic keratitis [Macsai et al 2001]. Although developmental delay appears to be common, it is unclear if ascertainment bias accounts for this and the reports of neurologic symptoms.Findings improve on a diet restricted in tyrosine and phenylalanine [Ellaway et al 2001].Tyrosinemia type III, the rarest of the tyrosine disorders, is caused by a deficiency of p-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid dioxygenase (EC.1.13.11.27). Plasma concentration of tyrosine ranges from 350 to 650 µmol/L. Excretion of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid, 4-hydroxyphenyllactate, and 4-hydroxyphenylacetate is increased. The precise quantities vary with protein intake.Few individuals with the disorder have been identified, and the clinical phenotype remains ill defined. The first affected individuals came to medical attention because of intellectual disability or ataxia; another was detected on routine screening [Mitchell et al 2001]. These individuals, like those with tyrosinemia type II, have no liver involvement but have skin or ocular changes. It remains unclear if tyrosinemia type III is truly associated with cognitive delays or if the association has resulted from ascertainment bias [Ellaway et al 2001].A diet low in phenylalanine and tyrosine can lower plasma tyrosine concentration.ManagementEvaluations Following Initial DiagnosisTo establish the extent of disease and needs of a child diagnosed with tyrosinemia type I on the basis of newborn screening, the following evaluations are recommended (see Table 3):CBC with platelet countSerum concentration of electrolytesAssessment of liver function (PT, PTT, AST, ALT, GGT, serum bilirubin concentration, alkaline phosphatase, and serum AFP).For children ascertained on the basis of clinical symptoms (see Table 4; pdf), testing should include the evaluations listed above in addition to:Baseline abdominal imagining by CT or MRI (with contrast) to evaluate for liver adenomas or nodules (see Dubois et al [1996]) and renal size;X-ray of wrist to document presence or absence of rickets.Clinical genetics consultation is indicated for all affected individuals.Treatment of ManifestationsManagement guidelines have been published. US recommendations include Chinsky et al [2017]; European recommendations include de Laet et al [2013].Acute management of liver failure. Children may require respiratory support, appropriate fluid management, and blood products for correction of bleeding diathesis.Nitisinone (Orfadin®). 2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoro-methylbenzyol) 1,3 cyclohexanedione (NTBC) blocks parahydroxyphenylpyruvic acid dioxygenase (p-HPPD), the second step in the tyrosine degradation pathway, and prevents the accumulation of FAA and its conversion to succinylacetone (Figure 1).Nitisinone should be prescribed as soon as the diagnosis of tyrosinemia type I is confirmed.Nitisinone is generally prescribed at 1.0 mg/kg/day; individual requirements may vary. Dosage should be adjusted to maintain blood nitisinone levels between 40 and 60 µmol/L, which theoretically blocks more than 99% of p-HPPD activity. Rarely, an individual may require higher blood levels of nitisinone (70 µmol/L) to suppress succinylacetone excretion. As long as blood concentration of nitisinone is within the therapeutic range, urine succinylacetone does not need to be measured.Nitisinone is typically given in two divided doses; however, because of the long half-life (50-60 hours), affected individuals who are older than one year and stable may maintain adequate therapy with 1x/day dosing [Schlune et al 2012].Rare side effects of nitisinone have included: transient low platelet count and transient low neutrophil count that resolved without intervention; and photophobia that resolved with stricter dietary control and subsequent lowering of blood tyrosine concentrations.Low-tyrosine diet. Nitisinone increases blood concentration of tyrosine, necessitating a low-tyrosine diet to prevent tyrosine crystals from forming in the cornea.Dietary management should be started immediately upon diagnosis and should provide a nutritionally complete diet with controlled intakes of phenylalanine and tyrosine using a vegetarian diet with low-protein foods and a medical formula such as Tyrex® (Ross) or Tyros-1® (Mead Johnson).Phenylalanine and tyrosine requirements are interdependent and vary from individual to individual and within the same individual depending on growth rate, adequacy of energy and protein intakes, and state of health. With appropriate dietary management, plasma tyrosine concentration should be 300-600 µmol/L, regardless of age; plasma phenylalanine concentration should be 20-80 µmol/L (0.3-1.3 mg/dL). If the blood concentration of phenylalanine is too low (<20 µmol/L), additional protein should be added to the diet from milk or foods.Liver transplantation. Prior to the availability of nitisinone for the treatment of tyrosinemia type I, the only definitive therapy was liver transplantation.Liver transplantation should be reserved for those children who (1) have severe liver failure at clinical presentation and fail to respond to nitisinone therapy or (2) have documented evidence of malignant changes in hepatic tissue [Bartlett et al 2014].Transplant recipients require long-term immunosuppression. Mortality associated with liver transplantation in young children is approximately 10%.Transplant recipients may also benefit from low-dose (0.1mg/kg/day) nitisinone therapy to prevent continued renal tubular and glomerular dysfunction resulting from persistence of succinylacetone in the plasma and urine [Bartlett et al 2013].Prevention of Primary ManifestationsTreatment with nitisinone (Orfadin®) should begin as soon as the diagnosis is confirmed.Prevention of Secondary ComplicationsBecause carnitine deficiency secondary to the renal tubular Fanconi syndrome can cause skeletal muscle weakness, serum concentration of carnitine should be measured so that carnitine deficiency, if identified, can be treated [Nissenkorn et al 2001].Osteoporosis and rickets resulting from renal tubular damage are treated by correction of acidosis, restoring of calcium and phosphate balance, and administration of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D.SurveillanceFrequent evaluation of the following parameters is typical in the management of individuals with tyrosinemia type I (Table 3) [CR Scott, personal recommendations].Table 3.

Prenatal testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk sibs before birth.Blood or urine succinylacetone analysis as soon as possible after birth if prenatal testing was not performed. This allows prompt initiation of treatment, as postnatal genetic testing results may not be available in a timely fashion.If the pathogenic variants in the family are not known, consideration of analysis for urine succinylacetone in healthy older sibsSee Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.Pregnancy ManagementLittle data exist on the use of nitisinone during human pregnancy. Speculation would assume that the pregnant woman remains safe from untoward events; however, the developing fetus may be at risk because of alterations in tyrosine metabolism.At least two women have given birth to healthy infants while receiving therapeutic doses of nitisinone [Garcia Segarra et al 2010].In one instance the affected mother gave birth to an unaffected infant who is reported to be healthy and developing normally at age 2.5 years [Garcia Segarra et al 2010, Vanclooster et al 2012].In another instance, an affected woman gave birth to an affected child. The child is reported to have normal growth and development at age seven months [Garcia Segarra et al 2010]. The authors speculate that the affected child was protected from in utero liver damage by maternal treatment with nitisinone during pregnancy.See MotherToBaby for more information on medication exposure during pregnancy.Therapies Under InvestigationSearch ClinicalTrials.gov in the US and EU Clinical Trials Register in Europe for access to information on clinical studies for a wide range of diseases and conditions. Note: There may not be clinical trials for this disorder.OtherPrior to the availability of nitisinone, the only available non-transplant therapy was a diet limiting the availability of phenylalorine and tyrosine. Although the diet was modestly helpful, recurrent episodes of neurologic crises and progression of liver disease occurred. Average survival was less than age ten years.'},\n",

       "   'text': 'Transient tachypnea of the newbornOther namesTransitory tachypnea of newbornSpecialtyPediatricsTransient tachypnea of the newborn is a respiratory problem that can be seen in the newborn shortly after delivery. It is caused by retained fetal lung fluid due to impaired clearance mechanisms.[1] It is the most common cause of respiratory distress in term neonates.[2][3] It consists of a period of rapid breathing (higher than the normal range of 30-60 times per minute). Usually, this condition resolves over 24–72 hours. Treatment is supportive and may include supplemental oxygen and antibiotics. The chest x-ray shows hyperinflation of the lungs including prominent pulmonary vascular markings, flattening of the diaphragm, and fluid in the horizontal fissure of the right lung.Contents1 Pathophysiology2 Diagnosis3 Treatment4 Epidemiology5 References6 External linksPathophysiology[edit]Due to the higher incidence of transient tachypnea of the newborn in infants delivered by caesarean section, it has been postulated that it could result from a delayed absorption of fetal lung fluid from the pulmonary lymphatic system. The increased fluid in the lungs leads to increased airway resistance and reduced lung compliance. It is thought this could be from lower levels of circulating catecholamines after a caesarean section, which are believed to be necessary to alter the function of the ENaC channel to absorb excess fluid from the lungs. Pulmonary immaturity has also been proposed as a causative factor. Levels of phosphatidylglycerol (an indicator of lung maturity) were found to be negative in certain newborns Mild surfactant deficiency has also been suggested as a causative factor.[citation needed]Diagnosis[edit]Transient tachypnea of the newborn is a diagnosis of exclusion as it is a benign condition that can have symptoms and signs similar to more serious conditions, such as respiratory distress syndrome.[2] A chest X-ray may show a radiopaque line - fluid - in the horizontal fissure of the right lung, fluid infiltrate throughout alveoli or fluid in individual lung lobes.[2] The lungs may also appear hyperinflated.[4]Treatment[edit]Supportive care is the treatment of choice for transient tachypnea of the newborn. This may include withholding oral feeding in periods of extreme tachypnea (over 60 breaths per minute) to prevent aspiration, supplemental oxygen, and CPAP.[5] Evidence from clinical trials investigating the use of postnatal corticosteroids for transient tachypnea of the newborn is inconclusive.[6] Similarly, the clinical trial evidence investigating non-invasive respiratory support (i.e. without endotracheal intubation) compared to supplemental oxygen is uncertain.[7]Epidemiology[edit]Transient tachypnea of the newborn occurs in approximately 1 in 100 preterm infants and 3.6-5.7 per 1000 term infants. It is most common in infants born by Cesarian section without a trial of labor after 35 weeks\\' gestation. Male infants and infants with an umbilical cord prolapse or perinatal asphyxia are at higher risk. Parental risk factors include use of pain control or anesthesia during labor, asthma, and diabetes.[5]References[edit]^ .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}Reuter S, Moser C, Baack M (October 2014). \"Respiratory distress in the newborn\".

       "   'text': 'Lennox–Gastaut syndromeGeneralized 3 Hz spike and wave discharges in a child with childhood absence epilepsy.SpecialtyNeurologyLennox–Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a complex, rare, and severe childhood-onset epilepsy. It is characterized by multiple and concurrent seizure types, cognitive dysfunction, and slow spike waves on electroencephalogram (EEG). Typically, it presents in children aged 3–5 years and can persist into adulthood.[1][2] It has been associated with several gene mutations, perinatal insults, congenital infections, brain tumors/malformations, and genetic disorders such as tuberous sclerosis and West syndrome. The prognosis for LGS is poor with a 5% mortality in childhood and persistent seizures into adulthood (80%–90%).[3]LGS was named for neurologists William G. Lennox (Boston, USA) and Henri Gastaut (Marseille, France),[4] who independently described the condition. The international LGS Awareness Day ison November 1.[5].mw-parser-output .toclimit-2 .toclevel-1 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-3 .toclevel-2 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-4 .toclevel-3 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-5 .toclevel-4 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-6 .toclevel-5 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-7 .toclevel-6 ul{display:none}Contents1 Signs and symptoms1.1 Seizures1.2 EEG findings1.3 Ocular abnormality2 Causes2.1 Brain injury2.2 Genetic mutations3 Diagnosis3.1 Ruling out other diagnosis4 Treatment4.1 Medications4.1.1 First-line drugs4.1.2 Second-line drugs4.1.3 Adjuvant drugs4.2 Surgery4.3 Diet5 Prognosis6 Epidemiology6.1 Finland6.2 United States7 Research8 References9 External linksSigns and symptoms[edit]The symptoms vary and progress with age. The symptoms are characterized by a triad of seizures, cognitive dysfunction, and EEG findings. The triad may not fully emerge until 1–2 years after first seizure episode.[citation needed]Seizures[edit]The peak age of onset of seizures is typically between 3 and 5 years of age.[6] The mainstay symptoms is seizures that are frequent – occurring daily – and difficult to treat with antiseizure medications. An estimated 30% of patients with infantile spasms (West syndrome) have been reported to progress to LGS.[7][8]The seizures are most commonly tonic seizures. They occur most frequently during non-REM sleep (90%). The seizures initially last only a few seconds and are activated by sleep. The presentation can be subtle. They present often as tonic eyelid opening with some changes in breathing coupled with pupillary dilation, urinary incontinence, increased heart rate, and flushing can occur.[citation needed]Nonconvulsive status epilepticus occurs in about 50% of patients. The seizures can cause sudden falling often leading to injury. These \"drop attacks\" are typically the first manifestation of LGS. The attacks are characterized by a single, generalized monoclonic jerk that precedes tonic contraction of axial muscles.[citation needed]EEG findings[edit]Findings that strongly suggest LGS include consistent slow spike-wave (< 3 hertz [Hz]) on awake EEG. The complexes typically consist of a spike (duration < 70 milliseconds) or a sharp wave (70-200 milliseconds), followed first by a positive deep trough, then a negative wave (350-400 milliseconds). Not every wave is preceded by a spike. Bursts increase and decrease without clear onset and offset.Slow spike waves may occur during seizure or between seizures, or may occur in absence of any observable clinical changes which helps distinguish pattern from extended 3-Hz spike-wave discharges.[citation needed]Ocular abnormality[edit]Ocular abnormalities affect around 90% of children. They can present as refractive error, strabismus, cortical visual impairment, and premature retinopathy.[9]Causes[edit]The disease pathophysiology is mostly unknown, but some evidence implicates cortical hyperexcitability occurring at critical periods of brain development.[citation needed]There are two types of LGS: idiopathic and secondary. The cause of the idiopathic subtype is unknown. Secondary LGS occurs when an identifiable underlying pathology is responsible. The most common type of LGS (70–78%) is secondary.[10] These patients tend to have a worse prognosis than those with idiopathic LGS.[11] In up to one-third of cases no cause can be found.[11]Brain injury[edit]Lennox-Gastaut most often occurs secondary to brain damage. The brain damage can occur from perinatal insults, encephalitis, meningitis, tumor, and brain malformation.[citation needed]Genetic mutations[edit]Other identified disorders include genetic disorders such as tuberous sclerosis and inherited deficiency of methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase. Some of these cases once thought to be of unknown cause may have definitive etiology by modern genetic testing.[11]Progress in genome and exome sequencing is revealing that some individuals diagnosed with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome have de novo mutations in a variety of genes, including CHD2, GABRB3, ALG13 and SCN2A.[12][13] The Epi4K study consortium (2013) observed de novo mutations in at least 15% of a study cohort of 165 patients with LGS and infantile spasms using whole exome sequencing.[14] A 2013 study found a high frequency of rare copy-number variation (CNV\\'s) in adult patients with LGS or LGS-like epilepsy.[15]Mutations in the IQSEC2 gene have been associated with this syndrome.[16] This gene is located on the short arm of the X chromosome (Xp11.22).[citation needed]Diagnosis[edit]The diagnosis of LGS should be suspected in children less than 8 years old with seizures of multiple types that cannot be treated with antiseizure medications. Because of high risk of irreversible brain damage in early stages of syndrome (particularly in infants and young children), early diagnosis is essential. It may take 1–2 years after first initial seizure for all criteria for diagnosis to emerge, so LGS should be considered if there are suggestive signs and symptoms without presence of complete triad.[citation needed]To confirm diagnosis, awake and asleep EEG and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are performed. MRI is used to detect focal brain lesions.[citation needed]Ruling out other diagnosis[edit]Certain diagnoses must be ruled out before diagnosing LGS. These diagnoses are:[citation needed]Doose syndromeDravet syndromepseudo-Lennox Gastaut syndrome (atypical benign partial epilepsy)LGS is more easily distinguished from Doose syndrome by seizure type after the syndrome has progressed. Doose syndrome has more myoclonic seizures and LGS has more tonic seizures. The Doose syndromes is less likely to have cognitive disabilities.[citation needed]The Dravet syndrome has a strong family history of epilepsy, unlike LGS. Also, many children with Dravet syndrome have seizures triggered by light.[citation needed]Pseudo-Lennox–Gastaut syndrome can be distinguished from LGS because pseudo-LGS has different spike-and-wave patterns on EEG.[citation needed]Treatment[edit]There are several treatment options, including medications, surgery, and diet.Medications[edit]In most patients with LGS, the treatment does not end seizure recurrence. The goals of treatment are to lower frequency and severity of seizures to greatest extent possible. The appropriate treatment varies depending on individual.[17]The treatments for LGS has evolved over the years. Various treatments have been shown to have some degree of efficacy. In 1997–1999, lamotrigine was found to be effective and approved by the Food and Drug Administration and Health Canada.[18][19][20] In 1999, topiramate trials showed that topiramate decreased seizure occurrence by more than 50%.[21][22]Felbamate is the treatment of last resort in the event that everything else fails,[23] and was found to be superior to placebo in controlling treatment resistant partial seizures and atonic seizures.[24][25] However, it has been known to cause aplastic anemia and liver toxicity.[26]First-line drugs[edit]valproate (valproic acid, sodium valproate and valproate semisodium)[citation needed]Second-line drugs[edit]lamotrigine[citation needed]Third-line drugsrufinamide[27]topiramate[citation needed]Treatment of last resortfelbamate[citation needed]Adjuvant drugs[edit]Are the following:[citation needed]benzodiazepines, specifically clonazepam, nitrazepam, and clobazamzonisamidecannabidiolSurgery[edit]In the past, LGS patients were not eligible for surgery, as the medical community thought the LGS involved the whole brain as a generalized epilepsy in all cases. Since 2010, this assumption has been challenged.[28] Two studies on LGS patients series who underwent curative surgery in Korea[29] and China,[30] showed very good results, up to seizure freedom for 80% of these patients below 5 years old, and 40% above 5 years old. Like all epilepsy curative surgeries, seizures may recur in the years following surgery, but surgery allows the child to have better brain development during the seizure free period.[citation needed]There are several procedures that have shown efficacy:[citation needed]vagus nerve stimulation, which involves implantation of battery-operated generator of intermittent electrical stimuli to an electrode wrapped around left vagus nerve. Some studies have been shown it to have greater than 50% reduction in seizures reported in more than half of patients.corpus callosotomy, which has shown to be effective with atonic seizures. This procedure is considered in cases in which vagus nerve stimulation has failedtranscranial direct current stimulationresectionDiet[edit]Main article: Ketogenic dietA ketogenic diet is a diet that causes ketosis, a state in which there is an increased amount of ketones in the body. Adopting and maintaining rigid diet may be difficult for some families. Short-term ketogenic diet might be associated with nonsignificant decreases in frequency of parent-reported seizures in children with LGS.[31] A case series study showed 50% seizure reduction reported in almost half of children with LGS after 1 year of ketogenic diet. However, the strength of the study is challenged because it represents reports rather than scientific analysis of the clinical outcomes such as in a randomized controlled trial.[32]Prognosis[edit]The mortality rate ranges from 3–7% in a mean follow up period of 8.5 to 9.7 years. Death is often related to accidents.[33]Epidemiology[edit]LGS is seen in approximately 4% of children with epilepsy, and is more common in males than in females.[10] Usual onset is between the ages of three and five.[6] Children can have no neurological problems prior diagnosis, or have other forms of epilepsy. West syndrome is diagnosed in 20% of patients before it evolves into LGS at about 2 years old.[11]Finland[edit]According to a 1997 community-based retrospective study in the Helsinki metropolitan area and the province of Uusimaa, the annual incidence of Lennox–Gastaut was 2 in 100,000 (0.002%) from 1975 to 1985.[34]United States[edit]0.026% of all children in the Atlanta, Georgia metropolitan area were estimated to have LGS in 1997, which was defined as, \"onset of multiple seizure types before age 11 years, with at least one seizure type resulting in falls, and an EEG demonstrating slow spike-wave complexes (<2.5 Hz).\" The study concluded that LGS accounts for 4% of childhood epilepsies.[10]Research[edit]Vigabatrin was found by Feucht et al. to be an effective add-on in patients whose seizures were not satisfactorily controlled by valproate. Out of 20 children, only 1 experienced a serious side effect (dyskinesia).[35]Zonisamideshowed promise in an overview of controlled and uncontrolled trials conducted in Japan.[36] However, in a physician survey conducted December 2004, only 28% of Lennox–Gastaut and West syndrome patients improved on zonisamide.[37]One yet to be published study from 2017 supported the use of cannabidiol.[38]A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine has shown a significant reduction of seizures in patients taking 10 and 20mg/kg a day compared to placebo.[citation needed]References[edit]^ .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}Markand, Omkar N.

Some people also suffer from tunnel vision, mostly due to blood flow leaving the head to more critical parts of the body in defense. These feelings may provoke a strong urge to escape or flee the place where the attack began (a consequence of the \"fight-or-flight response\", in which the hormone causing this response is released in significant amounts). This response floods the body with hormones, particularly epinephrine (adrenaline), which aid it in defending against harm.[9]A panic attack can result when up-regulation by the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is not moderated by the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS). The most common symptoms include trembling, dyspnea (shortness of breath), heart palpitations, chest pain (or chest tightness), hot flashes, cold flashes, burning sensations (particularly in the facial or neck area), sweating, nausea, dizziness (or slight vertigo), light-headedness, heavy-headedness, hyperventilation, paresthesias (tingling sensations), sensations of choking or smothering, difficulty moving, depersonalization and/or derealization. These physical symptoms are interpreted with alarm in people prone to panic attacks. This results in increased anxiety and forms a positive feedback loop.[10] Shortness of breath and chest pain are the predominant symptoms. People experiencing a panic attack may incorrectly attribute them to a heart attack and thus seek treatment in an emergency room. Because chest pain and shortness of breath are hallmark symptoms of cardiovascular illnesses, including unstable angina and myocardial infarction (heart attack), a diagnosis of exclusion (ruling out other conditions) must be performed before diagnosing a panic attack. It is especially important to do this for people whose mental health and heart health statuses are unknown. This can be done using an electrocardiogram and mental health assessments.Panic attacks are distinguished from other forms of anxiety by their intensity and their sudden, episodic nature.[9] They are often experienced in conjunction with anxiety disorders and other psychological conditions, although panic attacks are not generally indicative of a mental disorder. Causes[edit]There are long-term, biological, environmental, and social causes of panic attacks. In 1993, Fava et al. proposed a staging method of understanding the origins of disorders. The first stage in developing a disorder involves predisposing factors, such as genetics, personality, and a lack of well-being.[11] Panic disorder often occurs in early adulthood, although it may appear at any age. It occurs more frequently in women and more often in people with above-average intelligence.[citation needed] Various twin studies where one identical twin has an anxiety disorder have reported a high incidence of the other twin also having an anxiety disorder diagnosis.[12]Biological causes may include obsessive-compulsive disorder, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder, hypoglycemia, hyperthyroidism, Wilson\\'s disease, mitral valve prolapse, pheochromocytoma, and inner ear disturbances (labyrinthitis). Dysregulation of the norepinephrine system in the locus coeruleus, an area of the brain stem, has been linked to panic attacks.[13]Panic attacks may also occur due to short-term stressors. Significant personal loss, including an emotional attachment to a romantic partner, life transitions, and significant life changes may all trigger a panic attack to occur. A person with an anxious temperament, excessive need for reassurance, hypochondriacal fears,[14] overcautious view of the world,[9] and cumulative stress have been correlated with panic attacks. In adolescents, social transitions may also be a cause.[15]People will often experience panic attacks as a direct result of exposure to an object/situation that they have a phobia for. Panic attacks may also become situationally-bound when certain situations are associated with panic due to previously experiencing an attack in that particular situation. People may also have a cognitive or behavioral predisposition to having panic attacks in certain situations.Some maintaining causes include avoidance of panic-provoking situations or environments, anxious/negative self-talk (\"what-if\" thinking), mistaken beliefs (\"these symptoms are harmful and/or dangerous\"), and withheld feelings.Hyperventilation syndrome may occur when a person breathes from the chest, which can lead to over-breathing (exhaling excessive carbon dioxide related to the amount of oxygen in one\\'s bloodstream). Hyperventilation syndrome can cause respiratory alkalosis and hypocapnia. This syndrome often involves prominent mouth breathing as well. This causes a cluster of symptoms, including rapid heartbeat, dizziness, and lightheadedness, which can trigger panic attacks.[16]Panic attacks may also be caused by substances. Discontinuation or marked reduction in the dose of a substance such as a drug (drug withdrawal), for example, an antidepressant (antidepressant discontinuation syndrome), can cause a panic attack. According to the Harvard Mental Health Letter, \"the most commonly reported side effects of smoking marijuana are anxiety and panic attacks. Studies report that about 20% to 30% of recreational users experience such problems after smoking marijuana.\"[17] Cigarette smoking is another substance that has been linked to panic attacks.[18]A common denominator of current psychiatric approaches to panic disorder is that no real danger exists, and the person\\'s anxiety is inappropriate.[19]Panic disorder[edit]Main article: Panic disorderPeople who have repeated, persistent attacks or feel severe anxiety about having another attack are said to have panic disorder. Panic disorder is strikingly different from other types of anxiety disorders in that panic attacks are often sudden and unprovoked.[20] However, panic attacks experienced by those with panic disorder may also be linked to or heightened by certain places or situations, making daily life difficult.[21]Agoraphobia[edit]Main article: AgoraphobiaAgoraphobia is an anxiety disorder that primarily consists of the fear of experiencing a difficult or embarrassing situation from which the sufferer cannot escape. Panic attacks are commonly linked to agoraphobia and the fear of not being able to escape a bad situation.[22] As the result, severe sufferers of agoraphobia may become confined to their homes, experiencing difficulty traveling from this \"safe place\".[23] The word \"agoraphobia\" is an English adoption of the Greek words agora (αγορά) and Phobos (φόβος). The term \"agora\" refers to the place where ancient Greeks used to gather and talk about issues of the city, so it applies to any or all public places; however, the essence of agoraphobia is a fear of panic attacks especially if they occur in public as the victim may feel like he or she has no escape. In the case of agoraphobia caused by a social phobia or social anxiety, sufferers may be very embarrassed by having a panic attack publicly in the first place. This translation is the reason for the common misconception that agoraphobia is a fear of open spaces, and is not clinically accurate. Agoraphobia, as described in this manner, is a symptom professionals check for when making a diagnosis of panic disorder.People who have had a panic attack in certain situations may develop irrational fears, called phobias, of these situations and begin to avoid them. Eventually, the pattern of avoidance and level of anxiety about another attack may reach the point where individuals with panic disorder are unable to drive or even step out of the house. At this stage, the person is said to have panic disorder with agoraphobia.[citation needed]Experimentally induced[edit]Panic attack symptoms can be experimentally induced in the laboratory by various means. Among them, for research purposes, by administering a bolus injection of the neuropeptide cholecystokinin-tetrapeptide (CCK-4).[24] Various animal models of panic attacks have been experimentally studied.[25]Neurotransmitter imbalances[edit]Many neurotransmitters are affected when the body is under the increased stress and anxiety that accompany a panic attack. Some include serotonin, GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), dopamine, norepinephrine, and glutamate. More research into how these neurotransmitters interact with one another during a panic attack is needed to make any solid conclusions, however.An increase of serotonin in certain pathways of the brain seems to be correlated with reduced anxiety. More evidence that suggests serotonin plays a role in anxiety is that people who take SSRIs tend to feel a reduction of anxiety when their brain has more serotonin available to use.[26]The main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS) is GABA. Most of the pathways that use GABA tend to reduce anxiety immediately.[26]Dopamine\\'s role in anxiety is not well understood. Some antipsychotic medications that affect dopamine production have been proven to treat anxiety. However, this may be attributed to dopamine\\'s tendency to increase feelings of self-efficacy and confidence, which indirectly reduces anxiety.[26]Many physical symptoms of anxiety, such as rapid heart rate and hand tremors, are regulated by norepinephrine. Drugs that counteract norepinephrine\\'s effect may be effective in reducing the physical symptoms of a panic attack.[26] Nevertheless, some drugs that increase \\'background\\' norepinephrine levels such as tricyclics and SNRIs are effective for the long-term treatment of panic attacks, possibly by blunting the norepinephrine spikes associated with panic attacks.[27] Because glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter involved in the central nervous system (CNS), it can be found in almost every neural pathway in the body. Glutamate is likely involved in conditioning, which is the process by which certain fears are formed, and extinction, which is the elimination of those fears.[26]Pathophysiology[edit]The symptoms of a panic attack may cause the person to feel that their body is failing. The symptoms can be understood as follows. First, there is frequently the sudden onset of fear with little provoking stimulus. This leads to a release of adrenaline (epinephrine) which brings about the fight-or-flight response when the body prepares for strenuous physical activity. This leads to an increased heart rate (tachycardia), rapid breathing (hyperventilation) which may be perceived as shortness of breath (dyspnea), and sweating. Because strenuous activity rarely ensues, the hyperventilation leads to a drop in carbon dioxide levels in the lungs and then in the blood. This leads to shifts in blood pH (respiratory alkalosis or hypocapnia), causing compensatory metabolic acidosis activating chemosensing mechanisms that translate this pH shift into autonomic and respiratory responses.[28][29]Moreover, this hypocapnia and release of adrenaline during a panic attack cause vasoconstriction resulting in slightly less blood flow to the head which causes dizziness and lightheadedness.[30][31] A panic attack can cause blood sugar to be drawn away from the brain and toward the major muscles. Neuroimaging suggests heightened activity in the amygdala, thalamus, hypothalamus, and brainstem regions including the periaqueductal gray, parabrachial nucleus, and Locus coeruleus.[32] In particular, the amygdala has been suggested to have a critical role.[33] The combination of increased activity in the amygdala (fear center) and brainstem along with decreased blood flow and blood sugar in the brain can lead to decreased activity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) region of the brain.[34] There is evidence that having an anxiety disorder increases the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).[35] Those affected also have a reduction in heart rate variability.[35]Cardiovascular disease[edit]People who have been diagnosed with panic disorder have approximately double the risk of coronary heart disease.[36] Certain stress responses to depression also have been shown to increase the risk and those diagnosed with both depression and panic disorder are nearly three times more at risk.[36]Diagnosis[edit]DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for a panic attack include a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort, in which four (or more) of the following symptoms developed abruptly and reached a peak within minutes: Palpitations, and/or accelerated heart rateSweatingTrembling or shakingSensations of shortness of breath or being smotheredFeeling of chokingChest pain or discomfortNausea or abdominal distress Feeling dizzy, unsteady, lightheaded, or faintDerealization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (being detached from oneself)Fear of losing control or going insaneSense of impending doomParesthesias (numbness or tingling sensations)Chills or hot flashes In DSM-5, culture-specific symptoms (e.g., tinnitus, neck soreness, headache, and uncontrollable screaming or crying) may be seen. Such symptoms should not count as one of the four required symptoms.Some or all of these symptoms can be found in the presence of a pheochromocytoma.Screening tools such as the Panic Disorder Severity Scale can be used to detect possible cases of disorder and suggest the need for a formal diagnostic assessment.[37][38]Treatment[edit]Panic disorder can be effectively treated with a variety of interventions, including psychological therapies and medication.[9] Cognitive-behavioral therapy has the most complete and longest duration of effect, followed by specific selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.[39] A 2009 review found positive results from therapy and medication and a much better result when the two were combined.[40]Lifestyle changes[edit]Caffeine may cause or exacerbate panic anxiety. Anxiety can temporarily increase during withdrawal from caffeine and various other drugs.[41]Increased and regimented aerobic exercise such as running has been shown to have a positive effect on combating panic anxiety. There is evidence that suggests that this effect is correlated to the release of exercise-induced endorphins and the subsequent reduction of the stress hormone cortisol.[42]There remains a chance of panic symptoms becoming triggered or being made worse due to increased respiration rate that occurs during aerobic exercise. This increased respiration rate can lead to hyperventilation and hyperventilation syndrome, which mimics symptoms of a heart attack, thus inducing a panic attack.[43] The benefits of incorporating an exercise regimen have shown the best results when paced accordingly.[44]Muscle relaxation techniques are useful to some individuals. These can be learned using recordings, videos, or books. While muscle relaxation has proved to be less effective than cognitive-behavioral therapies in controlled trials, many people still find at least temporary relief from muscle relaxation.[14]Breathing exercises[edit]In the great majority of cases, hyperventilation is involved, exacerbating the effects of the panic attack. Breathing retraining exercise helps to rebalance the oxygen and CO2 levels in the blood.[45]David D. Burns recommends breathing exercises for those suffering from anxiety. One such breathing exercise is a 5-2-5 count. Using the stomach (or diaphragm)—and not the chest—inhale (feel the stomach come out, as opposed to the chest expanding) for 5 seconds. As the maximal point at inhalation is reached, hold the breath for 2 seconds. Then slowly exhale, over 5 seconds. Repeat this cycle twice and then breathe \\'normally\\' for 5 cycles (1 cycle = 1 inhale + 1 exhale). The point is to focus on breathing and relax the heart rate. Regular diaphragmatic breathing may be achieved by extending the out-breath by counting or humming.[citation needed]Although breathing into a paper bag was a common recommendation for short-term treatment of symptoms of an acute panic attack,[46] it has been criticized as inferior to measured breathing, potentially worsening the panic attack and possibly reducing needed blood oxygen.[47][48] While the paper bag technique increases needed carbon dioxide and so reduces symptoms, it may excessively lower oxygen levels in the bloodstream.Capnometry, which provides exhaled CO2 levels, may help guide breathing.[49][50]Therapy[edit]According to the American Psychological Association, \"most specialists agree that a combination of cognitive and behavioral therapies are the best treatment for panic disorder. Medication might also be appropriate in some cases.\"[51] The first part of therapy is largely informational; many people are greatly helped by simply understanding exactly what panic disorder is and how many others suffer from it. Many people who suffer from panic disorder are worried that their panic attacks mean they are \"going crazy\" or that the panic might induce a heart attack. Cognitive restructuring helps people replace those thoughts with more realistic, positive ways of viewing the attacks.[52] Avoidance behavior is one of the key aspects that prevent people with frequent panic attacks from functioning healthily.[14] Exposure therapy,[53] which includes repeated and prolonged confrontation with feared situations and body sensations, helps weaken anxiety responses to these external and internal stimuli and reinforce realistic ways of viewing panic symptoms.In deeper level psychoanalytic approaches, in particular object relations theory, panic attacks are frequently associated with splitting (psychology), paranoid-schizoid and depressive positions, and paranoid anxiety. They are often found comorbid with borderline personality disorder and child sexual abuse. Paranoid anxiety may reach the level of a persecutory anxiety state.[54]Meditation may also be helpful in the treatment of panic disorders.[55] There was a meta-analysis of the comorbidity of panic disorders and agoraphobia. It used exposure therapy to treat patients over a period. Hundreds of patients were used in these studies and they all met the DSM-IV criteria for both of these disorders.[56] A result was that thirty-two percent of patients had a panic episode after treatment. They concluded that the use of exposure therapy has lasting efficacy for a client who is living with a panic disorder and agoraphobia.[56]The efficacy of group therapy treatment over conventional individual therapy for people with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia appears similar.[57]Medication[edit]Medication options for panic attacks typically include benzodiazepines and antidepressants. Benzodiazepines are being prescribed less often because of their potential side effects, such as dependence, fatigue, slurred speech, and memory loss.[58] Antidepressant treatments for panic attacks include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors (MAOIs). SSRIs in particular tend to be the first drug treatment used to treat panic attacks. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and tricyclic antidepressants appear similar for short-term efficacy.[59]SSRIs carry a relatively low risk since they are not associated with much tolerance or dependence, and are difficult to overdose with. TCAs are similar to SSRIs in their many advantages but come with more common side effects such as weight gain and cognitive disturbances. They are also easier to overdose on. MAOIs are generally suggested for patients who have not responded to other forms of treatment.[60]While the use of drugs in treating panic attacks can be very successful, it is generally recommended that people also be in some form of therapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy. Drug treatments are usually used throughout the duration of panic attack symptoms and discontinued after the patient has been free of symptoms for at least six months. It is usually safest to withdraw from these drugs gradually while undergoing therapy.[14] While drug treatment seems promising for children and adolescents, they are at an increased risk of suicide while taking these medications and their well-being should be monitored closely.[60]Prognosis[edit]Roughly one-third are treatment-resistant.[61] These people continue to have panic attacks and various other panic disorder symptoms after receiving treatment.[61]Many people being treated for panic attacks begin to experience limited symptom attacks. These panic attacks are less comprehensive, with fewer than four bodily symptoms being experienced.[9]It is not unusual to experience only one or two symptoms at a time, such as vibrations in their legs, shortness of breath, or an intense wave of heat traveling up their bodies, which is not similar to hot flashes due to estrogen shortage. Some symptoms, such as vibrations in the legs, are sufficiently different from any normal sensation that they indicate a panic disorder. Other symptoms on the list can occur in people who may or may not have panic disorder. Panic disorder does not require four or more symptoms to all be present at the same time. Causeless panic and racing heartbeat are sufficient to indicate a panic attack.[9]Epidemiology[edit]In Europe, about 3% of the population has a panic attack in a given year while in the United States they affect about 11%.[2] They are more common in females than in males.[2] They often begin during puberty or early adulthood.[2] Children and older people are less commonly affected.[2] A meta-analysis was conducted on data collected about twin studies and family studies on the link between genes and panic disorder. The researchers also examined the possibility of a link to phobias, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and generalized anxiety disorder. The researchers used a database called MEDLINE to accumulate their data.[62] The results concluded that the aforementioned disorders have a genetic component and are inherited or passed down through genes. For the non-phobias, the likelihood of inheriting is 30–40%, and for the phobias, it was 50–60%.[62]See also[edit]Nervous breakdownPanicReferences[edit]^ a b .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}\"Anxiety Disorders\".

       "   'text': 'Laryngomalacia is an abnormality of the voice box (larynx) that leads to the inward collapse of the airway when air is drawn into the lungs (inspiration). It usually becomes apparent at birth or shortly after birth. The most common symptom is noisy breathing (stridor) that is often worse when the infant is on his/her back or crying. In more severe cases, symptoms may include difficulty breathing with the chest pulling inward (retraction), poor weight gain from difficulty feeding, apnea, andcyanosis. The underlying cause of the condition is unknown. Most cases occur sporadically in people with no family history of the condition. In 90% of affected infants, laryngomalacia will resolve on its own by the time an infant is 18 to 20 months old. However, severe cases may require immediate medical treatment such as medication or surgery.'},\n",

       "   'title': 'PYLORIC STENOSIS, INFANTILE HYPERTROPHIC, 1',\n",
       "   'text': 'DescriptionInfantile pyloric stenosis is the most common condition requiring surgical intervention in the first year of life. It typically presents in infants 2 to 6 weeks after birth. Clinically the disorder is characterized by projectile vomiting, visible gastric peristalsis, and a palpable pyloric tumor (summary by Everett et al., 2008). Mortality was high until successful treatment by pyloromyotomy was developed by Ramstedt (1912).Genetic Heterogeneity of Infantile Hypertrophic Pyloric StenosisMultiple susceptibility loci have been implicated in IHPS including IHPS1 on chromosome 12q, IHPS2 (610260) on chromosome 16p13-p12, IHPS3 (612017) on chromosome 11q14-q22, IHPS4 (300711) on chromosome Xq23, and IHPS5 (612525) on chromosome 16q24.InheritanceGenetic predisposition to IHPS was well established in the classic studies of Carter and Powell (1954) and Carter (1961), who defined the disease as a paradigm for the multifactorial sex-modified threshold model of inheritance, with affected males outnumbering females in a 4:1 ratio.Carter (1961) estimated that the recurrence risk was 10% for males born after an affected child and 1.5 to 2% for females.Finsen (1979) described a multigenerational family consistent with autosomal dominant transmission of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. Fried et al. (1981) reported an unusual family that appeared to represent autosomal dominant inheritance through 4 generations.Segregation analysis yields results best explained by a multifactorial sex-modified threshold model of inheritance (Carter and Evans, 1969; Lalouel et al., 1977), but the findings are also compatible with a single major dominant gene of low penetrance with a multifactorial background. Because pyloric stenosis was reported to occur in 4 of 7 cases of duplication of 9q11-q33 (Yamamoto et al., 1988), Chung et al. (1993) did a linkage study of this candidate region, searching for a gene predisposing to pyloric stenosis. The results of linkage studies in 20 families were negative.Mitchell and Risch (1993) reanalyzed several published family studies and concluded that the recurrence pattern was inconsistent with generalized single major locus inheritance. It was, however, considered compatible with multifactorial threshold inheritance or the effects of multiple interacting loci. Under a model of multiple interacting loci, no single locus could account for more than a 5-fold increase in the risk of first-degree relatives. In contrast to several earlier reports, this analysis did not support the existence of a maternal factor that contributed to the risk of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis in the offspring of affected females.Krogh et al. (2010) performed a population-based study of pyloric stenosis among 1,999,738 children born in Denmark between 1977 and 2008 and followed up for the first year of life. Surgery for pyloric stenosis occurred in 3,362 children, of which 2,741 (81.5%) were boys, resulting in a male-to-female ratio of 4.4:1. The incidence rate per 1,000 person-years was 1.8 for singletons and 3.1 for twins. The rate ratios of pyloric stenosis were 182 for monozygotic twins, 29.4 for dizygotic twins, 18.5 for sibs, 4.99 for half sibs, 3.06 for cousins, and 1.60 for half cousins. There were no differences in rate ratios for maternal and paternal relatives of children with pyloric stenosis, and no difference according to sex of cohort member or sex of relative. Overall, the findings indicated that pyloric stenosis in Danish children shows strong familial aggregation with a heritability of about 87%. However, the condition does not follow classic mendelian inheritance.Population GeneticsThe incidence of infantile pyloric stenosis was estimated to be between 1 and 5 per 1,000 live births in Britain (Davison, 1946; Dodge, 1975).There is a striking variation in incidence between population groups, with the cumulative incidence in American infants being 1.9 per 1,000 live births in whites, 1.8 in Hispanics, 0.7 in blacks, and 0.6 in Asians (Schechter et al., 1997).PathogenesisVanderwinden et al. (1992) concluded that lack of neuronal NOS1 in pyloric tissue is responsible for pylorospasm in IHPS. In biopsy specimens, NADPH-diaphorase (NDP) staining is absent in the neurons that innervate the circular muscle of the pylorus, and the nerve fibers themselves appear grossly abnormal and tortuous. (NDP, a histochemical enzymatic activity that reduces tetrazolium dyes in the presence of NADPH but not NADH, is due to neuronal NOS.) Support for the Vanderwinden hypothesis was provided by the demonstration by Huang et al. (1993) that in mice in whom targeted disruption of the neuronal NOS gene had been achieved by homologous recombination, grossly enlarged stomach with hypertrophy of the pyloric sphincter and the circular muscle layer was the most striking feature.Molecular GeneticsThe etiologic role of the NOS1 gene (163731) on chromosome 12q in infantile pyloric stenosis was investigated by analysis of 2 intragenic polymorphisms, NOS1a and NOS1b, in 27 families by Chung et al. (1996). They found significant overall transmission disequilibrium between pyloric stenosis and NOS1a (P = 0.006). Consideration of each allele independently revealed a significant tendency for preferential transmission of allele 7 (210 bp) to the affected offspring (P = 0.006). Chung et al. (1996) suggested that NOS1 is a susceptibility locus for pyloric stenosis. Findings leading to a contradictory conclusion were reported by Soderhall and Nordenskjold (1998), who could find no linkage between infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis and NOS1 in 3 Swedish families with multiple affected members. For these studies they used the AAT motif repeat in the first intron of the NOS1 gene.Saur et al. (2004) studied molecular mechanisms by which NOS1 gene expression is altered in pyloric tissues of 16 German infants with IHPS and 9 German controls. In IHPS patients, a significantly decreased expression of total NOS1 mRNA was found by quantitative RT-PCR; the decrease affected predominantly exon 1c, with a reduction of 88% compared with controls. Expression of exon 1f was increased significantly, indicating a compensatory upregulation of this NOS1 mRNA variant. Studying DNA samples of the 16 IHPS patients and 81 controls for mutations and SNPs in the NOS1 exon 1c promoter, Saur et al. (2004) found that carriers of the A allele of the exon 1c promoter -84G-A SNP (163731.0001) had increased risk of development of IHPS (odds ratio, 8.0). In contrast, Lagerstedt-Robinson et al. (2009) found no association between rs41279104 and infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis among 82 Swedish patients and 80 controls. The frequency of the A allele in the control group was 29%.INHERITANCE- Autosomal dominant- MultifactorialGROWTHOther- Failure to thriveABDOMENGastrointestinal- Infantile pyloric stenosis- Nonbilious projectile vomiting- Palpable pyloric \"olive\"- Visible gastric peristalsisMETABOLIC FEATURES- Hypochloremic metabolic alkalosisMISCELLANEOUS- Most common form of bowel obstruction in infancy- Sex ratio of 4-4.5 males to 1 female- Incidence 8/1,000 newborns- Onset of symptoms 2-4 weeks of ageMOLECULAR BASIS- Susceptibility conferred by mutation in the promoter of the nitric oxide synthase-1 gene (NOS1,163731.0001)▲Close'},\n",

Serum copper was low. The mother's brother was also thin and had been frequently ill as a child but had never had seizures. He had had blond, 'extremely curly' hair, but had been bald since age 24 years. His skin was seborrheic and serum copper was low. His 2 sons were healthy with brown, slightly curly hair and normal serum copper levels. Deficient dietary intake of copper and excessive renal loss were excluded. The authors suggested either X-linked or autosomal dominant inheritance and a defect in intestinal absorption of copper. Mehes and Petrovicz (1988-89) provided a 7-year follow-up.

       "   'text': 'A number sign (#) is used with this entry because of evidence that early infantile epileptic encephalopathy-46 (EIEE46) is caused by heterozygous mutation in the GRIN2D gene (602717) on chromosome 19q13.For a general phenotypic description and a discussion of genetic heterogeneity of EIEE, see EIEE1 (308350).Clinical FeaturesLi et al. (2016) reported 2 unrelated girls with severely delayed global development and onset of intractable seizures at 4 and 2 months of age, respectively. In the 8.5-year-old proband, EEG showed multifocal spike wave discharges, with hypsarrhythmia. She was seizure-free between about 3 and 5 years of age on levetiracetam; when this treatment was discontinued, seizures recurred with status epilepticus. She had very slow developmental progress with poor walking and few words. Other features included failure to thrive, poor feeding, dysphagia, constipation, mild cortical visual impairment, axial hypotonia, appendicular hypertonia, and minor dysmorphic features such as deep-set eyes, thick eyebrows, long eyelashes, tented upper lip, full cheeks, and widely spaced teeth. The other patient was a 2.7-year-old Tunisian girl with microcephaly, axial and orofacial hypotonia, and appendicular hypertonia who was unable to sit unassisted, speak words, or grasp objects. She had uncoordinated movements and was nondysmorphic except for severe pes planus.Tsuchida et al. (2018) reported 3 unrelated patients with EIEE46. The patients presented in the first months or years of life with global developmental delay and intractable seizures of various types. EEG showed multifocal discharges and diffuse spike and slow wave complexes. Additional variable features included jerky limb movements, hypotonia, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, ADHD, and autism. One patient could sit and roll over, but could not speak at age 8 years (Enjoji scale, less than 10). Another was able to walk and speak, but had impaired intellectual development (verbal IQ of 57, performance IQ of 68, and full-scale IQ of 58) at 15 years of age. The third patient, who was 8 years old, had no developmental progress beyond infancy and was unable to control his head, speak, or have eye contact. Brain imaging was normal in the first 2 patients; the third patient had loss of white matter volume, dilated ventricles, thin corpus callosum, and cerebral atrophy.Clinical ManagementAfter Li et al. (2016) identified a mutation in the GRIN2D gene in 2 girls with early infantile encephalopathy and obtained in vitro data, they treated both patients with various NMDAR antagonists, including memantine and ketamine, as well as magnesium, which causes voltage-dependent inhibition. The older girl was treated with memantine at age 6.5 years, with variable response and no sustained improvement. She was eventually treated with ketamine and magnesium, which resulted in better seizure control. The younger girl was started on memantine at age 2.5 years, which resulted in better seizure control and some developmental improvement.Molecular GeneticsIn 2 unrelated girls with EIEE46, Li et al. (2016) identified a de novo heterozygous missense mutation in the GRIN2D gene (V667I; 602717.0001). The mutation was found by whole-exome sequencing in the first patient and by sequencing of a targeted epilepsy gene panel in the second patient. The mutation occurred at a highly conserved residue in the M3 transmembrane domain that forms the ion channel core. Voltage clamp studies in transfected Xenopus oocytes and HEK293 cells showed that the mutation increased the receptor responsiveness to glutamate and glycine agonists, decreased the sensitivity of the channel to negative allosteric modulators, prolonged the deactivation time, and increased the channel opening probability, all consistent with a gain-of-function effect on the NMDA receptor. Transfection of the mutation into rat cortical neurons showed that it resulted in increased neuronal excitotoxicity that could be blocked by the NMDAR antagonist memantine.In 3 unrelated patients with EIEE46, Tsuchida et al.

It is probably not the HCG itself that causes the nausea. More likely, it is the HCG stimulating the maternal ovaries to secrete estrogen, which in turn causes the nausea.[13]Defense mechanism[edit]Morning sickness may be an evolved trait that protects the baby against toxins ingested by the mother. Evidence in support of this theory includes:[14][15]Morning sickness is very common among pregnant women, which argues in favor of its being a functional adaptation and against the idea that it is a pathology.Fetal vulnerability to toxins peaks at around 3 months, which is also the time of peak susceptibility to morning sickness.There is a good correlation between toxin concentrations in foods, and the tastes and odors that cause revulsion.Women who have no morning sickness are more likely to miscarry.[16] This may be because such women are more likely to ingest substances that are harmful to the fetus.[17]In addition to protecting the fetus, morning sickness may also protect the mother.A pregnant woman\\'s immune system is suppressed during pregnancy, presumably to reduce the chances of rejecting tissues of her own offspring.[18] Because of this, animal products containing parasites and harmful bacteria can be especially dangerous to pregnant women. There is evidence that morning sickness is often triggered by animal products including meat and fish.[19]If morning sickness is a defense mechanism against the ingestion of toxins, the prescribing of anti-nausea medication to pregnant women may have the undesired side effect of causing birth defects or miscarriages by encouraging harmful dietary choices.[14]Treatments[edit]There is a lack of good evidence to support the use of any particular intervention for morning sickness.[20]Medications[edit]A number of antiemetics are effective and safe in pregnancy including: pyridoxine/doxylamine, antihistamines (such as diphenhydramine), metoclopramide, and phenothiazines (such as promethazine).[21][22] With respect to effectiveness it is unknown if one is superior to another.[21] In the United States and Canada, the doxylamine-pyridoxine combination (as Diclegis in US and Diclectin in Canada) is the only approved pregnancy category \"A\" prescription treatment for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy.[22]Ondansetron may be beneficial, but there are some concerns regarding an association with cleft palate,[23] and there is little high quality data.[21] Metoclopramide is also used and relatively well tolerated.[24] Evidence for the use of corticosteroids is weak.[25]Alternative medicine[edit]Some studies support the use of ginger, but overall the evidence is limited and inconsistent.[3][7][20][26][8] Safety concerns have been raised regarding its anticoagulant properties.[27][28][8][29]History[edit]Thalidomide[edit]Thalidomide was originally developed and prescribed as a cure for morning sickness in West Germany, but its use was discontinued when it was found to cause birth defects.[30] The United States Food and Drug Administration never approved thalidomide for use as a cure for morning sickness.[31]References[edit]^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}\"Practice Bulletin No. 153: Nausea and Vomiting of Pregnancy\".

       "   'text': 'Relapsing feverSpecialtyInfectious diseaseRelapsing fever is a vector-borne disease caused by infection with certain bacteria in the genus Borrelia,[1] which is transmitted through the bites of lice or soft-bodied ticks (genus Ornithodoros).[2]Contents1 Signs and symptoms2 Causes2.1 Louse-borne relapsing fever2.2 Tick-borne relapsing fever3 Diagnosis4 Treatment5 Research6 History7 See also8 References9 External linksSigns and symptoms[edit]Most people who are infected develop sickness between 5 and 15 days after they are bitten. The symptoms may include a sudden fever, chills, headaches, muscle or joint aches, and nausea. A rash may also occur. These symptoms usually continue for 2 to 9 days, then disappear. This cycle may continue for several weeks if the person is not treated.[3]Causes[edit]Louse-borne relapsing fever[edit]Along with Rickettsia prowazekii and Bartonella quintana, Borrelia recurrentis is one of three pathogens of which the body louse (Pediculus humanus humanus) is a vector.[4] Louse-borne relapsing fever is more severe than the tick-borne variety.[citation needed]Louse-borne relapsing fever occurs in epidemics amid poor living conditions, famine and war in the developing world.[5] It is currently prevalent in Ethiopia and Sudan.Mortality rate is 1% with treatment and 30–70% without treatment. Poor prognostic signs include severe jaundice, severe change in mental status, severe bleeding and a prolonged QT interval on ECG.[citation needed]Lice that feed on infected humans acquire the Borrelia organisms that then multiply in the gut of the louse. When an infected louse feeds on an uninfected human, the organism gains access when the victim crushes the louse or scratches the area where the louse is feeding. B. recurrentis infects the person via mucous membranes and then invades the bloodstream. No non-human, animal reservoir exists.Tick-borne relapsing fever[edit]Tick-borne relapsing fever is found primarily in Africa, Spain, Saudi Arabia, Asia, and certain areas of Canada and the western United States. Other relapsing infections are acquired from other Borrelia species, which can be spread from rodents, and serve as a reservoir for the infection, by a tick vector.[citation needed]Borrelia crocidurae – occurs in Egypt, Mali, Senegal, Tunisia; vectors – Carios erraticus, Ornithodoros sonrai; animal host – shrew (Crocidura stampflii)Borrelia duttoni, transmitted by the soft-bodied African tick Ornithodoros moubata, is responsible for the relapsing fever found in central, eastern, and southern Africa.Borrelia hermsiiBorrelia hispanicaBorrelia miyamotoi[6]Borrelia parkeriBorrelia turicataeBorrelia persicaB. hermsii and B. recurrentis cause very similar diseases. However, one or two relapses are common with the disease associated with B. hermsii, which is also the most common cause of relapsing disease in the United States. (Three or four relapses are common with the disease caused by B. recurrentis, which has longer febrile and afebrile intervals and a longer incubation period than B. hermsii.)Diagnosis[edit]The diagnosis of relapsing fever can be made on blood smear as evidenced by the presence of spirochetes.Other spirochete illnesses (Lyme disease, syphilis, leptospirosis) do not show spirochetes on blood smear. Although considered the gold standard,this method lacks sensitivity and has been replaced by PCR in many settings.[7]Treatment[edit]Relapsing fever is easily treated with a one- to two-week-course of antibiotics, and most people improve within 24 hours. Complications and death due to relapsing fever are rare.Tetracycline-class antibiotics are most effective. These can, however, induce a Jarisch–Herxheimer reaction in over half those treated, producing anxiety, diaphoresis, fever, tachycardia and tachypnea with an initial pressor response followed rapidly by hypotension. Recent studies have shown tumor necrosis factor-alphamay be partly responsible for this reaction.Research[edit]Currently, no vaccine against relapsing fever is available, but research continues. Developing a vaccine is very difficult because the spirochetes avoid the immune response of the infected person (or animal) through antigenic variation. Essentially, the pathogen stays one step ahead of antibodies by changing its surface proteins. These surface proteins, lipoproteins called variable major proteins, have only 30–70% of their amino acid sequences in common, which is sufficient to create a new antigenic \"identity\" for the organism. Antibodies in the blood that are binding to and clearing spirochetes expressing the old proteins do not recognize spirochetes expressing the new ones.Antigenic variation is common among pathogenic organisms. These include the agents of malaria, gonorrhea, and sleeping sickness. Important questions about antigenic variation are also relevant for such research areas as developing a vaccine against HIV and predicting the next influenza pandemic.[citation needed]History[edit]Relapsing fever has been described since the days of the ancient Greeks.[8] After an outbreak in Edinburgh in the 1840s, relapsing fever was given its name, but the etiology of the disease was not better understood for a decade.[8] Physician David Livingstone is credited with the first account in 1857 of a malady associated with the bite of soft ticks in Angola and Mozambique.[9] In 1873, Otto Obermeier first described the disease-causing ability and mechanisms of spirochetes, but was unable to reproduce the disease in inoculated test subjects and thereby unable to fulfill Koch\\'s postulates.[8] The disease was notsuccessfully produced in an inoculated subject until 1874.[8] In 1904 and 1905, a series of papers outlined the cause of relapsing fever and its relationship with ticks.[10][11][12][13]Both Joseph Everett Dutton and John Lancelot Todd contracted relapsing fever by performing autopsies while working in the eastern region of the Congo Free State. Dutton died there on February 27, 1905. The cause of tick-borne relapsing fever across central Africa was named Spirillum duttoni.[14] In 1984, it was renamed Borrelia duttoni.[15] The first time relapsing fever was described in North America was in 1915 in Jefferson County, Colorado.[16]Sir William MacArthur suggested that relapsing fever was the cause of the yellow plague, variously called pestis flava, pestis ictericia, buidhe chonaill, or cron chonnaill, which struck early Medieval Britain and Ireland, and of epidemics which struck modern Ireland in the famine.[17][18] This is consistent with the description of the symptoms suffered by King Maelgwn of Gwynedd as recorded in words attributed to Taliesin and with the \"great mortality in Britain\" in 548 CE noted in the Annales Cambriae.See also[edit]Lyme diseaseTyphusContinuous feverIntermittent feverRemittent feverReferences[edit]^ .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}Schwan T (1996). \"Ticks and Borrelia: model systems for investigating pathogen-arthropod interactions\".

The syndrome was described in 1987 and named two years later.[1][2][3]Contents1 Signs and symptoms2 Cause3 Diagnosis4 Treatment5 Prognosis6 References7 External linksSigns and symptoms[edit]The key symptoms of PFAPA are those in its name: periodic high fever at intervals of about 3–5 weeks, as well as aphthous ulcers, pharyngitis and/or adenitis. In between episodes, and even during the episodes, the children appear healthy. At least 6 months of episodes. Diagnosis requires recurrent negative throat cultures and that other causes (such as EBV, CMV, FMF) be excluded.[3]Cause[edit]The cause of PFAPA is unknown.[4] It is frequently discussed together with other periodic fever syndromes.[3]Possible causes include primarily genetic or due to an initial infection.The condition appears to be the result of a disturbance of innate immunity.[5] The changes in the immune system are complex and include increased expression of complement related genes (C1QB, C2, SERPING1), interleulkin-1-related genes (interleukin-1B, interleukin 1 RN, CASP1, interleukin 18 RAP) and interferon induced (AIM2, IP-10/CXCL10) genes. T cell associated genes (CD3, CD8B) are down regulated. Flares are accompanied by increased serum levels of activated T lymphocyte chemokines(IP-10/CXCL10, MIG/CXCL9), G-CSF and proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin 6, interleukin 18). Flares also manifest with a relative lymphopenia. Activated CD4(+)/CD25(+) T-lymphocyte counts correlated negatively with serum concentrations of IP-10/CXCL10, whereas CD4(+)/HLA-DR(+) T lymphocyte counts correlated positively with serum concentrations of the counterregulatory IL-1 receptor antagonist.[citation needed]Diagnosis[edit]This section is empty. You can help by adding to it.(July 2018)Treatment[edit]PFAPA syndrome typically resolves spontaneously. Treatment options are used to lessen the severity of episodes.[6] Treatment is either medical or surgical.One treatment often used is a dose of a corticosteroid at the beginning of each fever episode.[4] A single dose usually ends the fever within several hours.[4] However, in some children, they can cause the fever episodes to occur more frequently.[4] Interleukin-1 inhibition appears to be effective in treating this condition.[5]There has been some evidence for the use of medications to reduce the frequency of flare-ups, including colchicine and cimetidine[7]Surgical removal of the tonsils appears to be beneficial compared to no surgery in symptom resolution and number of future episodes.[6] The evidence to support surgery is; however, of moderate quality.[6]Prognosis[edit]According to present research, PFAPA does not lead to other diseases and spontaneously resolves as the child gets older, with no long term physical effects.[2][8][9]However, PFAPA has been found in adults and may not spontaneously resolve.[10][non-primary source needed]References[edit]^ .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}Thomas, Kenneth Tyson; Feder, Henry M.; Lawton, Alexander R.; Edwards, Kathryn M.

The presence of fetal heart rate largely determines whether the pregnancy will progress to a viable outcome.[8]Ectopic pregnancy refers to a pregnancy outside the uterus, commonly in the fallopian tube. It is a less common but more serious cause of early pregnancy bleeding. Ectopic pregnancies can rupture, leading to internal bleeding that can be fatal if untreated.Implantation bleeding involves a small amount of bleeding that may occur 10 to 14 days after implantation of the fertilized egg. However, there is little evidence to support the existence of such bleeding.[9]Chorionic hematoma is the pooling of blood (hematoma) between the chorion, a membrane surrounding the embryo, and the uterine wall. It occurs in about 3.1% of all pregnancies and is the most common cause of first trimester bleeding.Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia, which refers to pregnancy-related tumors that be either cancerous or non-cancerous. This cause is extremely rare with non-cancerous gestational trophoblastic neoplasia found in 23 to 1,299 cases per 100,000 pregnancies and cancerous forms with a 10-fold lower incidence.[10]Obstetric causes of second/third trimester bleeding include the following:Bloody show refers to the passage of a small amount of blood or blood-tinged mucus resulting from labor or cervical weakness.Pregnancy loss refers to death of the fetus at any time during pregnancy. Pregnancy loss most commonly occurs during the first trimester, when it is referred to as early pregnancy loss.Placenta praevia or vasa praevia refers to the placenta or fetal blood vessels, respectively, covering or being located close to the opening of the uterus. More than half of women affected by placenta praevia (51.6)% have bleeding before delivery.[11] Vasa praevia occurs in about 0.6 per 1000 pregnancies.[12]Placental abruption involves the separation of the placental lining from the uterus of the mother. It occurs most commonly around 25 weeks of pregnancy.Uterine rupture is when the muscular wall of the uterus tears during childbirth or, less commonly, during pregnancy.Nontubal ectopic pregnancy refers to an ectopic pregnancy that occurs occurs in the ovary, cervix, or intra-abdominal cavity.Other causes of early pregnancy bleeding include the following:Postcoital bleeding, which is vaginal bleeding after sexual intercourse that can be normal with pregnancy.Iatrogenic causes, or bleeding due to medical treatment or intervention, such as sex steroids, anticoagulants, or intrauterine contraceptive devices.[13]Vaginal or cervical bleeding, which may arise from many causes including fibroids, polyps, warts, tumors, vaginitis, or trauma. Importantly, these causes may co-occur with other causes of early pregnancy bleeding.Lower genitourinary tract bleeding, which may result from a urinary tract infection (UTI), strenuous exercise, or bladder cancer.Pathophysiology[edit]Early pregnancy bleeding is usually from a maternal source, rather than a fetal, one. The maternal source may be a disruption in the vessels of the decidua or a lesion in the cervix or vagina. Vasa praevia is a rare condition that can result in bleeding from the fetoplacental circulation.Diagnostic approach[edit]The initial evaluation of early pregnancy bleeding involves a history and physical examination.[14] The relevant history includes determining the gestational age of fetus and characterizing the bleeding. Bleeding that is at least as heavy as menstrual bleeding or associated with clots, tissue, lightheadedness, or pelvic discomfort is associated with increased risks of ectopic pregnancy and spontaneous abortion.[14] Discomfort in the middle of the abdomen is more closely associated with spontaneous abortion; discomfort on a side of the abdomen is more closely associated with ectopic pregnancy. Risk factors for ectopic pregnancy or spontaneous abortion should also be considered.[14]The physical examination includes assessing vital signs and performing an abdominal and pelvic examination. Signs of hemodynamic instability or peritonitis require emergent intervention.[14] A pelvic examination may reveal non-obstetric causes of bleeding such as bleeding from the vagina or cervix. It may also show visible products of conception suggestive of an incomplete abortion.[14]If the person is stable and a pelvic exam is unrevealing, ultrasonography and/or serial measurement of hCG is generally recommended to assess fetal location and viability.[14] Before 10 weeks gestation, a slower than normal increase in hCG suggests early pregnancy loss or ectopic pregnancy.[14] By approximately 10 weeks, hCG plateaus and ultrasound is preferred to determine the location of the pregnancy (i.e., intrauterine or ectopic).[14] In the presence of prior pelvic imaging, fetal heart tracing with Doppler sonography is sufficient to assess fetal viability beginning at 10–12 weeks of gestation. Bleeding associated with an intrauterine, viable pregnancy suggests threatened early pregnancy loss.[14] Bleeding associated with an intrauterine, nonviable pregnancy suggests early pregnancy loss.[14] If the viability of an intrauterine pregnancy is uncertain, repeat ultrasonography coupled with laboratory measurement of progesterone and/or serial hCG can be helpful.[14] The absence of either intrauterine or ectopic pregnancy on imaging is suggestive of a complete early pregnancy loss (if the pregnancy was previously seen on imaging) or a pregnancy of unknown location (if the pregnancy was not previously seen on imaging).[14]Management[edit]The management of early pregnancy bleeding depends on its severity and cause.[1] People with significant blood loss who become hemodynamically unstable require rapid intervention. Laboratory studies that may be helpful include hemoglobin/hematocrit, coagulation studies, and type and crossmatch. Regardless of hemodynamic stability, a red blood cell antibody screen is usually checked. Patients who are Rh-negative are usually given anti-D immune globulin to prevent RhD isoimmunization.[4] The fetal heart rate can also be checked to assess the need for delivery.Ectopic pregnancy is treated with methotrexate therapy or surgery. Surgery is required for patients who have failed or have contraindications to methotrexate therapy, are experiencing significant blood loss, or have signs of ectopic rupture.[1] Threatened early pregnancy loss is often treated with watchful waiting.[3] Bed rest and progesterone therapy have not been shown to increase the likelihood of a viable outcome.[14][15] Early pregnancy loss can be treated with watchful waiting, medication, or uterine aspiration based on shared decision-making between the patient and provider.[14]Epidemiology[edit]First trimester bleeding is more common than second or third trimester bleeding. First trimester bleeding may be associated with smaller estimated fetal weight late in pregnancy.[16]References[edit]^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}Breeze, C (May 2016). \"Early pregnancy bleeding\".

       "   'text': 'Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy (EIEE)is a neurological disorder characterized by seizures. The disorder affects newborns, usually within the first three months of life (most often within the first 10 days) in the form of epileptic seizures. Infants have primarily tonic seizures (which cause stiffening of muscles of the body, generally those in the back, legs, and arms), but may also experience partial seizures, and rarely, myoclonic seizures (which cause jerks or twitches of the upper body, arms, or legs). Episodes may occur more than a hundred times per day. Most infants with the disorder showunderdevelopment of part or all of the cerebral hemispheresor structural anomalies. Some cases are caused by metabolic disorders or by mutationsin several different genes. The causefor many cases can’t be determined. There are several types of early infantile epileptic encephalopathy. The EEGsreveal a characteristic pattern of high voltage spike wave discharge followed by little activity. This pattern is known as “burst suppression.” The seizures associated with this disease are difficult to treat and the syndrome is severely progressive. Some children with this condition go on to develop other epileptic disorders such as West syndrome and Lennox-Gestaut syndrome.'},\n",

       "   'text': 'Childhood absence epilepsy (CAE), also known as pyknolepsy, is an idiopathic generalized epilepsy which occurs in otherwise normal children. The age of onset is between 4–10 years with peak age between 5–7 years. Children have absence seizures which although brief (~4–20 seconds), they occur frequently, sometimes in the hundreds per day. The absence seizures of CAE involve abrupt and severe impairment of consciousness. Mild automatisms are frequent, but major motor involvement early in the course excludes this diagnosis. The EEG demonstrates characteristic \"typical 3Hz spike-wave\" discharges. Prognosis is excellent in well-defined cases of CAE with most patients \"growing out\" of their epilepsy.[1]Contents1 Signs and symptoms2 Causes3 Pathophysiology4 Diagnosis5 Management6 Epidemiology7 See also8 References9 FootnotesSigns and symptoms[edit]This section is empty. You can help by adding to it.(September 2019)Causes[edit]CAE is a complex polygenic disorder. Particularly in the Han Chinese population there is association between mutations in CACNA1H and CAE. These mutations cause increased channel activity and associated increased neuronal excitability. Seizures are believed to originate in the thalamus, where there is an abundance of T-type calcium channels such as those encoded by CACNA1H.Pathophysiology[edit]There are currently 20 mutations in CACNA1H associated with CAE. These mutations are likely not wholly causative and should instead be thought of as giving susceptibility. This is particularly true since some groups have found no connection between CAE and CACNA1H mutations.[2] Many of the CACNA1H mutations have a measurable effect on channel kinetics, including activation time constant and voltage dependence, deactivation time constant, and inactivation time constant and voltage dependence (summarized in Table 1). Many of these mutations should lead to neuronal excitability, though others may lead to hypoexcitability. These predictions are due to mathematical modeling and may differ from what will occur in real neurons where other proteins, some of which may interact with CACNA1H, are present.Along with mutations in CACNA1H, two mutations in the gene encoding a GABAA receptor γ subunit are also associated with a CAE like phenotype that also overlaps with generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus type-3. The first of these, R43Q, abolishes benzodiazepine potentiation of GABA induced currents.[3][4] The second associated mutation, C588T has not been further characterized.Table 1.

It is more likely to affect the first-born with males more commonly than females at a ratio of 4 to 1.[7] The vomiting is often described as non-bile stained (\"non bilious\") and \"projectile vomiting\", because it is more forceful than the usual spitting up (gastroesophageal reflux) seen at this age.Some infants present with poor feeding and weight loss but others demonstrate normal weight gain. Dehydration may occur which causes a baby to cry without having tears and to produce less wet or dirty diapers due to not urinating for hours or for a few days. Symptoms usually begin between 3 and 12 weeks of age. Findings include epigastric fullness with visible peristalsis in the upper abdomen from the infant\\'s left to right.[8] Constant hunger, belching, and colic are other possible signs that the baby is unable to eat properly.Cause[edit]Rarely, infantile pyloric stenosis can occur as an autosomal dominant condition.[9]It is uncertain whether it is a congenital anatomic narrowing or a functional hypertrophy of the pyloric sphincter muscle.[citation needed]Pathophysiology[edit]The gastric outlet obstruction due to the hypertrophic pylorus impairs emptying of gastric contents into the duodenum. As a consequence, all ingested food and gastric secretions can only exit via vomiting, which can be of a projectile nature. While the exact cause of the hypertrophy remains unknown, one study suggested that neonatal hyperacidity may be involved in the pathogenesis.[10] This physiological explanation for the development of clinical pyloric stenosis at around 4 weeks and its spontaneous long term cure without surgery if treated conservatively, has recently been further reviewed.[11]Persistent vomiting results in loss of stomach acid (hydrochloric acid). The vomited material does not contain bile because the pyloric obstruction prevents entry of duodenal contents (containing bile) into the stomach. The chloride loss results in a low blood chloride level which impairs the kidney\\'s ability to excrete bicarbonate. This is the factor that prevents correction of the alkalosis leading to metabolic alkalosis.[12]A secondary hyperaldosteronism develops due to the decreased blood volume. The high aldosterone levels causes the kidneys to avidly retain Na+ (to correct the intravascular volume depletion), and excrete increased amounts of K+ into the urine (resulting in a low blood level of potassium).[citation needed]The body\\'s compensatory response to the metabolic alkalosis is hypoventilation resulting in an elevated arterial pCO2.Diagnosis[edit]Pyloric stenosis as seen on ultrasound in a 6 week old[13]Diagnosis is via a careful history and physical examination, often supplemented by radiographic imaging studies. Pyloric stenosis should be suspected in any young infant with severe vomiting. On physical exam, palpation of the abdomen may reveal a mass in the epigastrium. This mass, which consists of the enlarged pylorus, is referred to as the \\'olive\\',[14] and is sometimes evident after the infant is given formula to drink. Rarely, there are peristaltic waves that may be felt or seen (video on NEJM) due to the stomach trying to force its contents past the narrowed pyloric outlet.[citation needed]Most cases of pyloric stenosis are diagnosed/confirmed with ultrasound, if available, showing the thickened pylorus and non-passage of gastric contents into the proximal duodenum. Muscle wall thickness 3 millimeters (mm) or greater and pyloric channel length of 15mm or greater are considered abnormal in infants younger than 30 days. Gastric contents should not be seen passing through the pylorus because if it does, pyloric stenosis should be excluded and other differential diagnoses such as pylorospasm should be considered. The positions of superior mesenteric artery and superior mesenteric vein should be noted because altered positions of the these two vessels would be suggestive of intestinal malrotation instead of pyloric stenosis.[7]Although the baby is exposed to radiation, an upper GI series (x-rays taken after the baby drinks a special contrast agent) can be diagnostic by showing the pylorus with elongated, narrow lumen and a dent in the duodenal bulb.[7] A \"string sign\" or the \"railroad track sign\".For either type of study, there are specific measurement criteria used to identify the abnormal results.Plain x-rays of the abdomen sometimes shows a dilated stomach.Although UGI endoscopy would demonstrate pyloric obstruction, physicians would find it difficult to differentiate accurately between hypertrophic pyloric stenosis and pylorospasm.[citation needed]Blood tests will reveal low blood levels of potassium and chloride in association with an increased blood pH and high blood bicarbonate level due to loss of stomach acid (which contains hydrochloric acid) from persistent vomiting. There will be exchange of extracellular potassium with intracellular hydrogen ions in an attempt to correct the pH imbalance. These findings can be seen with severe vomiting from any cause.[citation needed]Treatment[edit]Vertical Pyloromyotomy scar (large) 30 hrs post-op in a one-month-old babyHorizontal Pyloromyotomy scar 10 days post-op in a one-month-old babyInfantile pyloric stenosis is typically managed with surgery;[15] very few cases are mild enough to be treated medically.The danger of pyloric stenosis comes from the dehydration and electrolyte disturbance rather than the underlying problem itself. Therefore, the baby must be initially stabilized by correcting the dehydration and the abnormally high blood pH seen in combination with low chloride levels with IV fluids. This can usually be accomplished in about 24–48 hours.[citation needed]Intravenous and oral atropine may be used to treat pyloric stenosis. It has a success rate of 85-89% compared to nearly 100% for pyloromyotomy, however it requires prolonged hospitalization, skilled nursing and careful follow up during treatment.[16] It might be an alternative to surgery in children who have contraindications for anesthesia or surgery, or in children whose parents do not want surgery.Surgery[edit]The definitive treatment of pyloric stenosis is with surgical pyloromyotomy known as Ramstedt\\'s procedure (dividing the muscle of the pylorus to open up the gastric outlet).This surgery can be done through a single incision (usually 3–4cm long) or laparoscopically (through several tiny incisions), depending on the surgeon\\'s experience and preference.[17]Today, the laparoscopic technique has largely supplanted the traditional open repairs which involved either a tiny circular incision around the navel or the Ramstedt procedure.Compared to the older open techniques, the complication rate is equivalent, except for a markedly lower risk of wound infection.[18]This is now considered the standard of care at the majority of children\\'s hospitals across the US, although some surgeons still perform the open technique. Following repair, the small 3mm incisions are hard to see.The vertical incision, pictured and listed above, is no longer usually required, though many incisions have been horizontal in the past years.Once the stomach can empty into the duodenum, feeding can begin again. Some vomiting may be expected during the first days after surgery as the gastrointestinal tract settles. Rarely, the myotomy procedure performed is incomplete and projectile vomiting continues, requiring repeat surgery. Pyloric stenosis generally has no long term side-effects or impact on the child\\'s future.[citation needed]Epidemiology[edit]Males are more commonly affected than females, with firstborn males affected about four times as often, and there is a genetic predisposition for the disease.[19] It is commonly associated with people of Scandinavian ancestry, and has multifactorial inheritance patterns.[9] Pyloric stenosis is more common in Caucasians than Hispanics, Blacks, or Asians. The incidence is 2.4 per 1000 live births in Caucasians, 1.8 in Hispanics, 0.7 in Blacks, and 0.6 in Asians. It is also less common amongst children of mixed race parents.[20]Caucasian male babies with blood type B or O are more likely than other types to be affected.[19]Infants exposed to erythromycin are at increased risk for developing hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, especially when the drug is taken around two weeks of life[21] and possibly in late pregnancy and through breastmilk in the first two weeks of life.[22]References[edit]^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}Ranells JD, Carver JD, Kirby RS (2011). \"Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: epidemiology, genetics, and clinical update\".

       "   'text': 'Giggle incontinence, giggle enuresis or enuresis risoria isthe involuntary release of urine in response to giggling or laughter.The bladder may empty completely or only partially.[1]Giggle incontinence is more common in children than adults, typically appearing at ages 5 to 7,[2] and is most common in girls near the onset of puberty.[3]The condition tends to improve with age, with fewer episodes during the teenage years,[2]but may persist into adulthood.[3]A survey of 99 student nurses indicated that about 25% had experienced such a wetting event during their lifetime, and about 10% were still susceptible in their late teens.[1]Giggle incontinence is a special form of urge incontinence,[4] and is not the same as stress incontinence, which is generally brought on by participating in vigorous sport.[3]Contents1 Cause2 Social consequences3 Treatment4 See also5 ReferencesCause[edit]Involuntary urination, the bladder\\'s normally relaxed detrusor muscle contracts to squeeze urine from the bladder.One study, of 109 children diagnosed with giggle incontinence at Schneider Children\\'s Hospital in New York, concluded that the cause of giggle incontinence is involuntary contraction of the detrusor muscle induced by laughter.[5]Because the complaint is difficult to reproduce under controlled conditions, its triggering mechanism is not clearly understood,[6] but may be related to cataplexy, a sudden transient episode of loss of muscle tone often triggered by strong emotions.[7]Social consequences[edit]Episodes of giggle incontinence are embarrassing and socially incapacitating, diminishing the quality of life.Those having the condition learn to adapt by avoiding activities that may bring on laughter.[3]Other approaches include limiting fluid intake, trying to remain seated, and concealing leakage by wearing absorbent pads and dark clothing.[8]Treatment[edit]Favorable response to treatment with the ADHD drug methylphenidate (Ritalin) has been reported,[3][7][9] but this treatment option is not acceptable to all patient families.[9] Dr. Lane Robson, of The Children\\'s Clinic in Calgary, Alberta, says \"If a child is having a wetting episode once a month, medicating them daily is probably not a good treatment. If it\\'s a daily issue, you may have to make that decision.\"[8]See also[edit]Urinary incontinenceReferences[edit]^ a b .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}Glahn, B.

They may notice either a distinct \"gush\" or a steady flow of small amounts of watery fluid in the absence of steady uterine contractions.[8] Loss of fluid may be associated with the baby becoming easier to feel through the belly (due to the loss of the surrounding fluid), decreased uterine size, or meconium (fetal stool) seen in the fluid.[9]Risk factors[edit]A fetus surrounded by the amniotic sac which is enclosed by fetal membranes. In PROM, these membranes rupture before labor starts.The cause of PROM is not clearly understood, but the following are risk factors that increase the chance of it occurring. In many cases, however, no risk factor is identified.[10]Infections: urinary tract infection, sexually transmitted diseases, lower genital tract infections (e.g. bacterial vaginosis),[8] infections within the amniotic sac membranes (chorioamnionitis)[11]Tobacco use during pregnancy[10]Illicit drug use during pregnancy[11]Having had PROM or preterm delivery in previous pregnancies[8]Polyhydramnios: too much amniotic fluid [9]Multiple gestation: being pregnant with two or more fetuses at one time[8]Having had episodes of bleeding anytime during the pregnancy[8]Invasive procedures (e.g. amniocentesis)[9]Nutritional deficits[10]Cervical insufficiency: having a short or prematurely dilated cervix during pregnancy[9]Low socioeconomic status[10]Being underweight[10]Pathophysiology[edit]10-week-old human embryo surrounded by amniotic fluid and fetal membranesWeak membranes[edit]Fetal membranes likely break because they become weak and fragile. This weakening is a normal process that typically happens at term as the body prepares for labor and delivery. However, this can be a problem when it occurs before 37 weeks (preterm). The natural weakening of fetal membranes is thought to be due to one or a combination of the following. In PROM, these processes are activated too early:[citation needed]Cell death: when cells undergo programmed cell death, they release biochemical markers that are detected in higher concentrations in cases of PPROM.Poor assembly of collagen: collagen is a molecule that gives fetal membranes, as well as other parts of the human body such as the skin, their strength. In cases of PPROM, proteins that bind and cross-link collagen to increase its tensile strength are altered.Breakdown of collagen: collagen is broken down by enzymes called matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are found at higher levels in PPROM amniotic fluid. This breakdown results in prostaglandin production which stimulates uterine contractions and cervical ripening. MMPs are inhibited by tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs) which are found at lower levels in PPROM amniotic fluid.[10]Infection[edit]Infection and inflammation likely explains why membranes break earlier than they are supposed to. In studies, bacteria have been found in the amniotic fluid from about one-third of cases of PROM. Often, testing of the amniotic fluid is normal, but a subclinical infection (too small to detect) or infection of maternal tissues adjacent to the amniotic fluid, may still be a contributing factor. In response to infection, the resultant infection and release of chemicals (cytokines) subsequently weakens the fetal membranes and put them at risk for rupture.[10] PROM is also a risk factor in the development of neonatal infections.[citation needed]Genetics[edit]Many genes play a role in inflammation and collagen production, therefore inherited genes may play a role in predisposing a person to PROM.[10]Diagnosis[edit]To confirm if a woman has experienced PROM, a clinician must prove that the fluid leaking from the vagina is amniotic fluid, and that labor has not yet started. To do this, a careful medical history is taken, a gynecological exam is conducted using a sterile speculum, and an ultrasound of the uterus is performed.[9]History: a person with PROM typically recalls a sudden \"gush\" of fluid loss from the vagina, or steady loss of small amounts of fluid.[9]Sterile speculum exam: a clinician will insert a sterile speculum into the vagina in order to see inside and perform the following evaluations. Digital cervical exams, in which gloved fingers are inserted into the vagina to measure the cervix, are avoided until the women is in active labor to reduce the risk of infection.[12]Pooling test: Pooling is when a collection of amniotic fluid can be seen in the back of the vagina (vaginal fornix). Sometimes leakage of fluid from the cervical opening can be seen when the person coughs or performs a valsalva maneuver.[9]Nitrazine test: A sterile cotton swab is used to collect fluid from the vagina and place it on nitrazine (phenaphthazine) paper. Amniotic fluid is mildly basic (pH 7.1–7.3) compared to normal vaginal secretions which are acidic (pH 4.5–6).[10] Basic fluid, like amniotic fluid, will turn the nitrazine paper from orange to dark blue.[9]Fern test: A sterile cotton swab is used to collect fluid from the vagina and place it on a microscope slide. After drying, amniotic fluid will form a crystallization pattern called arborization[11] which resembles leaves of a fern plant when viewed under a microscope.[8]Fibronectin and alpha-fetoprotein blood testsClassification[edit]Prelabor rupture of membranes (PROM): when the fetal membranes rupture early, at least one hour before labor has started.[8]Prolonged PROM: a case of prelabor rupture of membranes in which more than 18 hours has passed between the rupture and the onset of labor.[13]Preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM): prelabor rupture of membranes that occurs before 37 weeks gestation.Midtrimester PPROM or pre-viable PPROM: prelabor rupture of membranes that occurs before 24 weeks\\' gestation. Before this age, the fetus cannot survive outside of the mother\\'s womb.[12]Additional tests[edit]The following tests should only be used if the diagnosis is still unclear after the standard tests above.Ultrasound: Ultrasound can measure the amount of fluid still in the uterus surrounding the fetus. If the fluid levels are low, PROM is more likely.[8] This is helpful in cases when the diagnosis is not certain, but is not, by itself, definitive.[11]Immune-chromatological tests are helpful, if negative, to rule out PROM, but are not that helpful if positive since the false-positive rate is relatively high (19–30%).[11]Indigo carmine dye test: a needle is used to inject indigo carmine dye (blue) into the amniotic fluid that remains in the uterus through the abdominal wall. In the case of PROM, blue dye can be seen on a stained tampon or pad after about 15–30 minutes.[9] This method can be used to definitively make a diagnosis, but is rarely done because it is invasive and increases risk of infection. But, can be helpful if the diagnosis is still unclear after the above evaluations have been done.[9]It is unclear if different methods of assessing the fetus in a woman with PPROM affects outcomes.[14]False positives[edit]Like amniotic fluid, blood, semen, vaginal secretions in the presence of infection,[9] soap,[10] urine, and cervical mucus[8] also have an alkaline pH and can also turn nitrazine paper blue.[9] Cervical mucus can also make a pattern similar to ferning on a microscope slide, but it is usually patchy[9] and with less branching.[8]Differential diagnosis[edit]Other conditions that may present similarly to premature rupture of membranes are the following:[8]Urinary incontinence: leakage of small amounts of urine is common in the last part of pregnancyNormal vaginal secretions of pregnancyIncreased sweat or moisture around the perineumIncreased cervical discharge: this can happen when there is a genital tract infectionSemenDouchingVesicovaginal fistula: an abnormal connection between the bladder and the vaginaLoss of the mucus plugPrevention[edit]Women who have had PROM are more likely to experience it in future pregnancies.[11] There is not enough data to recommend a way to specifically prevent future PROM. However, any woman that has had a history of preterm delivery, because of PROM or not, is recommended to take progesterone supplementation to prevent recurrence.[11][9]Management[edit]Summary[11]Fetal ageManagementTerm> 37 weeksInduction of laborAntibiotics if needed to prevent group B streptococcus (GBS) transmissionLate pre-term34–36 weeksSame as for termPreterm24–33 weeksWatchful waiting (expectant management)Tocolytics to prevent the beginning of laborMagnesium sulfate infusion for 24–48 hours to allow maximum efficacy of corticosteroids for fetal lungs and also confer benefit to fetal brain and gut before deliveryOne time dose of corticosteroids (two separate administrations, 12–24 hours apart) before 34 weeksAntibiotics if needed to prevent GBS transmissionPre-viable< 24 weeksDiscussion of watchful waiting or induction of laborNo antibiotics, corticosteroids, tocolysis, or magnesium sulfateThe management of PROM remains controversial, and depends largely on the gestational age of the fetus and other complicating factors. The risks of quick delivery (induction of labor) vs. watchful waiting in each case is carefully considered before deciding on a course of action.[11]As of 2012, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists advised, based on expert opinion and not clinical evidence, that attempted delivery during maternal instability increases the rates of both fetal death and maternal death, unless the source of instability is an intrauterine infection.[15]In all women with PROM, the age of the fetus, its position in the uterus, and its well being should be evaluated. This can be done with ultrasound, Doppler fetal heart rate monitoring, and uterine activity monitoring. This will also show whether or not uterine contractions are happening which may be a sign that labor is starting. Signs and symptoms of infection should be closely monitored, and, if not already done, a group B streptococcus (GBS) culture should be collected.[citation needed]At any age, if the fetal well-being appears to be compromised, or if intrauterine infection is suspected, the baby should be delivered quickly by induction of labour.[11][12]Term[edit]Both expectant management (watchful waiting) and an induction of labor (artificially stimulating labor) are considered in this case. 90% of women start labor on their own within 24 hours, and therefore it is reasonable to wait for 12–24 hours as long as there is no risk of infection.[12]However, if labor does not begin soon after the PROM, an induction of labor is recommended because it reduces rates of infections, decreases the chances that the baby will require a stay in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), and does not increase the rate of caesarean sections.[11] If a woman strongly does not want to be induced, watchful waiting is an acceptable option as long as there is no sign of infection, the fetus is not in distress, and she is aware and accepts the risks of PPROM.[11] There is not enough data to show that the use of prophylactic antibiotics (to prevent infection) is beneficial for mothers or babies at or near term because of the potential side effects and development of antibiotic resistance.[16]34 to 37 weeks[edit]When the fetus is 34 to 37 weeks gestation, the risk of being born prematurely must be weighed against the risk of PROM. Previously it was recommended that delivery be carried out as if the baby was term.[11][8] A 2017 Cochrane review however found waiting resulted in better outcomes when pregnancy is before 37 weeks.[5]24 to 34 weeks[edit]Before 34 weeks, the fetus is at a much higher risk of the complications of prematurity. Therefore, as long as the fetus is doing well, and there are no signs of infection or placental abruption, watchful waiting (expectant management) is recommended.[11] The younger the fetus, the longer it takes for labor to start on its own,[9] but most women will deliver within a week.[10] Waiting usually requires a woman to stay in the hospital so that health care providers can watch her carefully for infection, placental abruption, umbilical cord compression, or any other fetal emergency that would require quick delivery by induction of labor.[11]In 2017, a review of watchful waiting vs the early birth strategy was conducted to ascertain which was associated with a lower overall risk. Focusing on the 24–37-week range, the review analysed twelve randomised controlled trials from the \"Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth\\'s Trials Register\", concluding that \"In women with PPROM before 37 weeks\\' gestation with no contraindications to continuing the pregnancy, a policy of expectant management with careful monitoring was associated with better outcomes for the mother and baby.\"[5]There is believed to be a correlation between volume of amniotic fluid retained and neonatal outcomes before 26 weeks\\' gestation.[10] Amniotic fluid levels are an important consideration when debating expectant management vs clinical intervention, as low levels, or oligohydramnios, can result in lung and limb abnormalities.[10] Additionally, labor and infection are less likely to occur when there are sufficient levels of amniotic fluid remaining in the uterus.[8] Serial amnioinfusion in pregnancies with PPROM-related oligohydramnios at less than 26 weeks gestation, successfully alleviates oligohydramnios, with perinatal outcomes that are significantly better than the outcome in those with the persistent condition and is comparable with gestations with PPROM in which oligohydramnios never develops.[17]Recommended[edit]Monitoring for infection: signs of infection include a fever in the mother, fetal tachycardia (fast heart rate of the fetus, more than160 beats per minute), or tachycardia in the mother (more than 100 beats per minute). White blood cell (WBC) counts are not helpful in this case because WBC\\'s are normally high in late pregnancy.[11]Steroids before birth: corticosteroids (betamethasone) given to the mother of a baby at risk of being born prematurely can speed up fetal lung development and reduce the risk of death of the infant, respiratory distress syndrome, brain bleeds, and bowel necrosis.[11] It is recommended that mothers receive one course of corticosteroids between 24 and 34 weeks when there is a risk of preterm delivery. In cases of PPROM these medications do not increase the risk of infection even though steroids are known to suppress the immune system. More than two courses is not recommended because three or more can lead to small birth weight and small head circumference.[11] In pregnancies between 32 and 34 weeks (right around the time that fetal lungs mature) vaginal fluid can be tested to determine fetal lung maturity using chemical markers which can help to decide if corticosteroids should be given.[9]Magnesium sulfate: Intravenous magnesium sulfate is given to the mother in cases when there is a risk of preterm birth before 32 weeks. This has been shown to protect the fetal brain and reduce the risk of cerebral palsy.[11]Latency antibiotics: The time from PROM to labor is termed the latency period, and there is an inverse relationship between gestational age and the length of latency, meaning that the earlier the rupture, the longer it will take for labor to begin naturally.[8] As expected, antibiotics given to mothers that experience PPROM serve to protect against infections during this lengthened latency period. Additionally, antibiotics increase the time that babies stay in the womb. Antibiotics don\\'t seem to prevent death or make a difference in the long-term (years after the baby is born). But, because of the short-term benefits, routine use of antibiotics in PPROM is still recommended.[18] The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends a seven-day course of intravenous ampicillin and erythromycin followed by oral amoxicillin and erythromycin if watchful waiting is attempted before 34 weeks.[11] Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid increases the risk of fetal bowel death (necrotizing enterocolitis) and should be avoided in pregnancy.[11]Prophylactic antibiotics: If a woman is colonized with GBS, than the typical use of antibiotics during labor is recommended to prevent transmission of this bacteria to the fetus, regardless of earlier treatments.[11]Controversial or not recommended[edit]Preventative tocolysis (medications to prevent contractions): the use of tocolytic medications to prevent labor contractions is controversial. On the one hand, this can delay delivery and allow the fetus more time to develop and benefit from antenatal corticosteroid medication, on the other hand it increases the risk of infection or chorioamnionitis. The use of tocolysis has not shown to benefit mom or baby and currently there is not enough data to recommend or discourage its use in the case of preterm PROM.[11][19]Therapeutic tocolysis (medications to stop contractions): Once labor has started, using tocolysis to stop labor has not been shown to help, and is not recommended.[11]Amnioinfusion: This treatment attempts to replace the lost amniotic fluid from the uterus by infusing normal saline fluid into the uterine cavity. This can be done through the vagina and cervix (transcervical amnioinfusion) or by passing a needle through the abdominal wall (transabdominal amnioinfusion). Current data suggests that this treatment prevents infection, lung problems, and fetal death. However, there have not been enough trials to recommend its routine use in all cases of PPROM.[20]Home care: Typically women with PPROM are managed in the hospital, but, occasionally they opt to go home if watchful waiting is attempted. Since labor usually starts soon after PPROM, and infection, umbilical cord compression, and other fetal emergencies can happen very suddenly, it is recommended that women stay in the hospital in cases of PPROM after 24 weeks.[11] Currently, there is not enough evidence to determine meaningful differences in safety, cost, and women\\'s views between management at home vs. the hospital.[21]Sealing membranes after rupture:Infection is the major risk associated with PROM and PPROM.[22] By closing the ruptured membranes, it is hoped that there would be a decrease in infection, as well as encouraging the re-accumulation of amniotic fluid in the uterus to protect the fetus and allow for further lung development. Common techniques include placing a sponge over the ruptured membrane and the use of oral autoimmune stimulating drugs to encourage the body\\'s immune system to repair the rupture. There is currently insufficient research to determine whether these or other resealing techniques improve maternal or neonatal outcomes when compared to the current standard of care.[23]Before 24 weeks[edit]Before 24 weeks, a fetus is not viable meaning it cannot live outside the mother. In this case, either watchful waiting at home or an induction of labor done.[11]Because the risk of infection is so high, the mother should check her temperature often and return to the hospital if she develops any signs or symptoms of infection, labor, or vaginal bleeding. These women are typically admitted to the hospital once their fetus reaches 24 weeks and then managed the same as women with PPROM before 34 weeks (discussed above). When possible, these deliveries should take place in a hospital that has expertise in the management of the potential maternal and neonatal complications, and has the necessary infrastructure in place to support the care of these patients (i.e. neonatal intensive care unit).[24] Antenatal corticosteroids, latency antibiotics, magnesium sulfate, and tocolytic medications are not recommended until the fetus reaches viability (24 weeks).[11] In cases of pre-viable PPROM, chance of survival of the fetus is between 15–50%, and the risk of chorioamnionitis is about 30%.[9]Chorioamnionitis[edit]Chorioamnionitis is a bacterial infection of the fetal membranes, which can be life-threatening to both mother and fetus. Women with PROM at any age are at high risk of infection because the membranes are open and allow bacteria to enter. Women are checked often (usually every 4 hours) for signs of infection: fever (more than 38°C or 100.5°F), uterine pain, maternal tachycardia, fetal tachycardia, or foul-smelling amniotic fluid.[10] Elevated white blood cells are not a good way to predict infection because they are normally high in labor.[9] If infection is suspected, artificial induction of labor is started at any gestational age and broad antibiotics are given. Caesarean section should not be automatically done in cases of infection, and should only be reserved for the usual fetal emergencies.[9]Outcomes[edit]The consequences of PROM depend on the gestational age of the fetus.[8] When PROM occurs at term (after 36 weeks), it is typically followed soon thereafter by the start of labor and delivery. About half of women will give birth within 5 hours, and 95% will give birth within 28 hours without any intervention.[11] The younger the baby, the longer the latency period (time between membrane rupture and start of labor). Rarely, in cases of preterm PROM, amniotic fluid will stop leaking and the amniotic fluid volume will return to normal.[11]If PROM occurs before 37 weeks, it is called preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM), and the baby and mother are at greater risk of complications. PPROM causes one-third of all preterm births.[19] PROM provides a path for disease-causing organisms to enter the womb and puts both the mother and baby at risk for infection. Low levels of fluid around the baby also increase the risk of umbilical cord compression and can interfere with lung and body formation of the baby in early pregnancy.[19]Infection (any age)[edit]At any gestational age, an opening in the fetal membranes provides a route for bacteria to enter the womb. This can lead to chorioamnionitis (an infection of the fetal membranes and amniotic fluid) which can be life-threatening to both the mother and fetus.[8] The risk of infection increases the longer the membranes remain open and baby undelivered.[11] Women with preterm PROM will develop an intra-amniotic infection 15–25% of the time, and the chances of infection increase at earlier gestational ages.[11]Pre-term birth (before 37 weeks)[edit]PROM occurring before 37 weeks (PPROM) is one of the leading causes of preterm birth. Thirty to 35% of all preterm births are caused by PPROM.[10] This puts the fetus at risk for the many complications associated with prematurity such as respiratory distress, brain bleeds, infection, necrotizing enterocolitis (death of the fetal bowels), brain injury, muscle dysfunction, and death.[8] Prematurity from any cause leads to 75% of perinatal mortality and about 50% of all long-term morbidity.[25] PROM is responsible for 20% of all fetal deaths between 24 and 34 weeks\\' gestation.[10]Fetal development (before 24 weeks)[edit]Before 24 weeks the fetus is still developing its organs, and the amniotic fluid is important for protecting the fetus against infection, physical impact, and for preventing the umbilical cord from becoming compressed. It also allows for fetal movement and breathing that is necessary for the development of the lungs, chest, and bones.[8]Low levels of amniotic fluid due to mid-trimester or previable PPROM (before 24 weeks) can result in fetal deformity (e.g. Potter-like facies), limb contractures, pulmonary hypoplasia (underdeveloped lungs),[11] infection (especially if the mother is colonized by group B streptococcus or bacterial vaginosis), prolapsed umbilical cord or compression, and placental abruption.[9]PROM after second-trimester amniocentesis[edit]Most cases of PROM occur spontaneously, but the risk of PROM in women undergoing a second trimester amniocentesis for prenatal diagnosis of genetic disorders is 1%. Although, no studies are known to account for all cases of PROM that stem from amniocentesis. This case, the chances of the membranes healing on their own and the amniotic fluid returning to normal levels is much higher than spontaneous PROM. Compared to spontaneous PROM, about 70% of women will have normal amniotic fluid levels within one month, and about 90% of babies will survive.[11]Epidemiology[edit]Of term pregnancies (more than 37 weeks) about 8% are complicated by PROM,[10] 20% of these become prolonged PROM.[9] About 30% of all preterm deliveries (before 37 weeks) are complicated by PPROM, and rupture of membranes before viability (before 24 weeks) occurs in less than 1% of all pregnancies.[11] Since there are significantly fewer preterm deliveries than term deliveries, the number of PPROM cases make up only about 5% of all cases of PROM.[9]See also[edit]Placental alpha microglobulin-1 (PAMG-1)IGFBP1 (Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1)References[edit]^ a b c d e .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}Norwitz, Errol R.; Arulkumaran, S.; Symonds, I.

       "   'text': 'Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis is a genetic disease that causes episodes of extreme muscle weakness and an increase of the potassium levels in the blood. Muscle weakness during an attack usually affects the arms and legs and muscles of the eyes, throat, and trunk. Most often, these episodes involve a temporary inability to move muscles in the arms and legs. Episodes usually begin before age 20, usually between infancy and age 10. Normally an episode lasts for 15 minutes to an hour, but in some people the episodes may last a few days to a week. Episodes tend to increase in frequency until about age 50, after which they may occur less frequently. Factors that can trigger attacks include rest after strenuous exercise, potassium-rich foods, stress, fatigue, and exposure to cold. Depolarizing anesthetics should also be avoided. Muscle strength usually returns to normal between episodes, although manypeople continue to experience mild stiffness, particularly in muscles of the face and hands. Studies suggest more than 80% of people with hyperkalemic periodic paralysis over age 40 have permanent muscle weakness, most often affecting the leg muscles. About one third may develop a chronic progressive myopathy.  Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis is caused by mutations in the SCN4A gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominantmanner. Diagnosis is based on clinical symptoms including the increase of blood potassium level during an episode, but normal levels of blood potassium level in between episodes. Genetic testing can confirm the diagnosis. Treatment is focused on avoiding triggers and decreasing the severity of an episode. At the first sign of muscle weakness, episodes in many people may be prevented or stopped by mild exercise and/or eating carbohydrates, inhalation of salbutamol, or intravenous calcium gluconate.'},\n",

At age 2 years, she did not yet walk or speak, and she exhibited clearly delayed psychomotor development. At age 3 years 9 months, occasional convulsions, predominantly localized to the shoulders and upper back, were reported, which led to the diagnosis of myoclonic epilepsy. At age 5 years 6 months, her physical development was in the normal range. She had no dysmorphic features. Screening for inborn errors of metabolism resulted in no indication of amino acidopathies or organic acidurias.Shoichet et al. (2003) reported 2 male probands with X-linked mental retardation without dysmorphic features or additional neurologic abnormalities. The proband in 1 family had delayed early milestones and at the age of 5 years was functioning at an intellectual level of age 3 years. He exhibited language retardation, avoided social contact, and was hyperactive. Both of the mother's brothers were affected but further clinical data were not available. The proband in the other family reached early milestones within the normal time frame, but exhibited a severe language delay. At age 10 years, he was unable to read, had essentially no acquisition of mathematics skills, and required special education. He had mood disorders, with both hyperactivity and aggressiveness.HistoryIn a 7-year-old girl with severe mental retardation and a de novo balanced translocation t(X;7)(p11.3;q11.21), Shoichet et al. (2003) cloned the DNA fragment that contained the X chromosomal and the autosomal breakpoint. In silico sequence analysis demonstrated that the ZNF41 gene was disrupted. Expression studies indicated that ZNF41 transcripts were absent in the patient cell line, suggesting that the mental disorder in this patient resulted from loss of functional ZNF41. Moreover, screening of a panel of patients with nonsyndromic MRX led to the identification of ZNF41 mutations in affected members of 2 unrelated families (314995.0001-314995.0002).Piton et al. (2013) found the mutations in ZNF41 identified by Shoichet et al. (2003) in a total of 7 males in the NHLBI Exome Variant Server; they also found truncating ZNF41 variants in 1 male and 1 female in that database. Based on these findings, as well as a lack of reported ZNF41 mutations since 2003, Piton et al.

       "   'title': 'Childhood absence epilepsy',\n",
       "   'text': 'Childhood absence epilepsy is a condition characterized by recurrent seizures (epilepsy). This condition begins in childhood, usually between ages 3 and 8. Affected children have absence seizures (also known as petit mal seizures), which are brief episodes of impaired consciousness that look like staring spells. During seizures, children are not aware of and do not respond to people or activities around them. The seizures usually last several seconds and they occur often, up to 200 times each day.Some affected individuals have febrile seizures before they develop childhood absence epilepsy. Febrile seizures are involuntary muscle contractions (convulsions) brought on by a high body temperature (fever).In most people with childhood absence epilepsy, the absence seizures disappear in adolescence. However, some affected individuals continue to have absence seizures into adulthood, or they may develop generalized tonic-clonic seizures, which cause muscle rigidity, convulsions, and loss of consciousness, or myoclonic seizures, which are characterized by rapid, uncontrolled muscle jerks.FrequencyChildhood absence epilepsy affects 2 to 8 in 100,000 children under age 15 each year. The condition is more common in girls than in boys.CausesThe genetics of childhood absence epilepsy are complex and not completely understood. It is thought that multiple genetic changes or a combination of genetic and environmental factors contribute to development of the condition. Most genetic changes associated with childhood absence epilepsy are rare, having been found in only a small number of affected individuals. Each genetic change appears to play a role in some populations but not others.Several genes associated with childhood absence epilepsy provide instructions for making pieces (subunits) of the GABAA receptor protein. The GABAA receptor acts as a channel that allows negatively charged chlorine atoms (chloride ions) to cross the cell membrane. The influx of chloride ions in nerve cells (neurons) in developed brains creates an environment that blocks (inhibits) signaling between neurons and prevents the brain from being overloaded with too many signals. Mutations in GABAA receptor subunit genes lead to production of altered subunit proteins that cannot form functional receptors, so fewer GABAA receptors are available. As a result, neurons become overloaded with signals. Researchers believe that the overstimulation of certain neurons in the brain triggers the abnormal brain activity associated with seizures.Problems with another type of ion channel, called a calcium channel, are also associated with childhood absence epilepsy. Calcium channels transport positively charged calcium atoms (calcium ions) into cells. These channels help control the release of neurotransmitters, which are chemicals that relay signals from one neuron to another. Mutations that result in overactive calcium channels cause certain neurons to become overstimulated, triggering seizures.Mutations in other genes that do not provide instructions for making ion channels have also been associated with childhood absence epilepsy. It is not clear how these changes are involved in the development of absence seizures.Learn more about the gene associated with Childhood absence epilepsyGABRA1Additional Information from NCBI Gene:CACNA1HGABRB3GABRG2JRKInheritance PatternBecause childhood absence epilepsy appears to be a complex disease without a single genetic cause, it does not have a straightforward pattern of inheritance. When associated with mutations in GABAA receptor or calcium channel genes, it seems to follow an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase the likelihood of the disorder. Some people who have the altered gene never develop the condition, a situation known as reduced penetrance.'},\n",

       "   'text': 'This article is an orphan, as no other articles link to it. Please introduce links to this page from related articles; try the Find link tool for suggestions.(February 2017)Infantile apneaSpecialtyPediatricInfantile apnea is a rare disease that is characterized by cessation of breathing in an infant for at least 20 seconds or a shorter respiratory pause that is associated with a slow heart rate, bluish discolouration of the skin, extreme paleness, gagging, choking and/or decreased muscle tone.[1][2] Infantile apnea occurs in children under the age of one and it is more common in premature infants.[3] Symptoms of infantile apnea occur most frequently during the rapid eye movement (REM) stage of sleep.[4] The nature and severity of breathing problems in patients can be detected in a sleep study called a polysomnography which measures the brain waves, heartbeat, body movements and breathing of a patient overnight.[4] Infantile apnea can be caused by developmental problems that result in an immature brainstem or it can be caused other medical conditions.[1][4][5] As children grow and develop, infantile apnea usually does not persist.[4] Infantile apnea may be related to some cases of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) however, the relationship between infantile apnea and SIDS is not known.[3]Contents1 Cause2 Diagnosis2.1 Classification2.1.1 Central Apnea2.1.2 Obstructive Apnea2.1.3 Mixed Apnea3 Epidemiology4 ReferencesCause[edit]√ having a family history of sleep apnea.√ being overweight or obese.✓ having certain medical conditions (cerebral palsy, Down syndrome, sickle cell disease, abnormalities in the skull or face)✓ being born with a low birth weight.✓ having a large tongue.Diagnosis[edit]Classification[edit]There are three major categories of apnea known as central, obstructive, and mixed apnea.[1][3][4]Central Apnea[edit]Central apnea is characterized by insufficient responsiveness from respiratory centers such as the medulla, which results in poor coordination of the body systems that are necessary for breathing.[1][4] Respiratory muscles and nerves to lose the ability to effectively receive and process signals from the brain causing respiratory efforts to cease.[4] Central apnea is quite common and can be found in healthy, full-term infants for short periods of time before breathing patterns in the infant stabilize.[4] In premature infants, central apnea is attributed to an underdeveloped respiratory system which results in decreased response to higher carbon dioxide levels and difficulty breathing.[1] Head trauma may also cause central apnea as it interferes with normal signalling of the central respiratory system, this might be present in infants who suffer from abuse so investigating patient background is an important consideration.[1]Obstructive Apnea[edit]Obstructive apnea occurs when the airway passages are obstructed and little to no air exchange occurs, resulting in impaired breathing.[1][4] In some cases, it occurs when patients are born with a small airway opening.[4] Patients with obstructive apnea often have vigorous inspiratory effort but the efforts are still ineffective.[1] Normally, the muscles at the level of the throat relax and dilate while asleep in order to open up airway however, patients with obstructive apnea may have decreased neuromuscular tone of the muscles responsible for dilating the pharynx during sleep.[4] The inability of the vocal cords to move and the presence of a foreign body may also cause obstructive apnea.[1][6] Cases of obstructive apnea are rarely found in infants that are healthy.[4]Mixed Apnea[edit]Mixed apnea is a combination of both central and obstructive factors.[1] The majority of premature infants with sleep apnea have mixed apnea.[4]Epidemiology[edit]When infants have a lower birth weight or younger gestational age, there is a greater risk of infantile apnea.[1] With the advancement of neonatal intensive care units and the greater technology available, there are more successful premature births compared to the past.[1] With the greater number of premature infants being born, there is also a greater number of children with infantile apnea.[1][5] Approximately 85 percent of infants born with a weight less than 2.2 pounds (1kg) experience infantile apnea within the first month after birth.[4] This risk decreases to 25 percent for infants weighing less than 5.5 pounds (2.5kg).[4] Studies have found that almost 2% of the pediatric population experience obstructive sleep apnea.[1]References[edit]^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n .mw-parser-output

       "   'text': 'Childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) is a familial generalized pediatric epilepsy, characterized by very frequent (multiple per day) absence seizures, usually occurring in children between the ages of 4 and 10 years, with, in most cases, a good prognosis.Epidemiology\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCAE accounts for 10% to 17% of all cases of epilepsy diagnosed in school-aged children. Incidence has been estimated at 1/50,000-1/12,500 in the United States. Females are usually more affected than males.Clinical description\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCAE usually occurs in children between the ages of 4 and 10 years, with a peak between 5 and 7 years. The disease is characterized by frequent (multiple per day) absence seizures with an abrupt onset and offset. Photosensitivity is reported in 18% of CAE patients. In rare cases, CAE is also associated with an increased rates of adverse behavioral, psychiatric, language, and subtle cognitive comorbidities (including attention problems, anxiety, depression, social isolation and low self-esteem). These cognitive concerns are frequently complicated by attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Intellectual disability may also be observed. Onset of absence seizures under the age of 4 years is observed in a rare subset of CAE patients, a proportion of whom have encephalopathy due to GLUT1 deficiency (see this term).Etiology\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAlthough CAE is genetically determined, the precise mode of inheritance and genes involved remain largely unidentified. Mutations in the genes NIPA2 (15q11.2) which encodes a magnesium transporter; CACNA1H (16p13.3) which encodes a T-type calcium channel are reported to be susceptibility genes in Chinese Han population; GABRA1 (5q34), GABRB3 (15q12), GABRG2 (5q34) which encode gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors; JRK (8q24.3) which encodes a putative DNA-binding protein; and SLC2A1 (1p34.2) which encodes a facilitated glucose transporter, may be implicated in CAE. Mutations in CLCN2 (3q27.1) which encodes a chloride channel, may be a susceptibility locus in a subset of CAE.Diagnostic methods\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tDiagnosis relies on the clinical features and electroencephalographic findings of bilateral, synchronous symmetrical spike waves, usually 3 Hz, on a normal background activity.Differential diagnosis\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tDifferential diagnosis includes epilepsy with myoclonic absences, Jeavons syndrome, juvenile absence epilepsy, perioral myoclonia with absences, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, encephalopathy due to GLUT1 deficiency as well as absences associated with chromosomal anomalies (ring chromosome 20, 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome) (see these terms).Management and treatment\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTreatment of CAE involves the use of antiepileptic drugs such as ethosuximide, valproate, and lamotrigine. However, lack of response is common. Levetiracetam (alternative choice for patients with CAE and photosensitivity) or topiramate are options for refractory absence seizures but may not be successful.Prognosis\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIn 56-65% of affected children, a 5-year remission rate off antiepileptic drugs is observed. Terminal remission generally occurs 3-8 years after the onset of CAE. However, in the remaining 30% of children, seizures persist either as absences alone (10-15%), absences with either generalized tonic-clonic or myoclonic seizure (5-15%), or evolution to juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (5-15%).'},\n",

(2010) reported 2 patients, related as double first cousins, with a unique combination of developmental delay, agenesis of the corpus callosum, and congenital lymphedema. Both were born by emergency cesarean and had difficulty in the newborn period. The first patient, a girl, was born at 31 weeks' gestation due to preeclampsia and suspected placental insufficiency. She had severe intrauterine growth retardation and microcephaly at birth. The second patient, a boy, was born at 35 weeks' gestation for reduced fetal movements and oligohydramnios. Both patients had a sacral dimple at birth with no associated abnormalities and pulmonary hypertension in the newborn period. Both had lymphedema at birth, in the lower limbs in the girl and in all 4 limbs in the boy. The lymphedema had resolved or was resolving by age 2 years. At age 3, the girl showed significant developmental delay, with inability to walk independently and few single words. The boy also had global developmental delay but could walk independently and speak a few words. Both patients had mild facial dysmorphism, with dolichocephaly, wide anterior fontanel, short palpebral fissures, epicanthal folds, low-set and posteriorly rotated ears, upturned nose, long philtrum, thin upper lip, and high-arched palate. Brain MRI of both patients showed severe partial or almost complete agenesis of the corpus callosum, respectively, mild hippocampal dysplasia, basal ganglia cysts, and laterally displaced lateral ventricles. Other features included a cheerful personality and gastroesophageal reflux disease. O'Driscoll et al. (2010) noted some phenotypic overlap with Hennekam syndrome (235510) and FG syndrome (305450), but concluded that the patients did not fit into either category, suggesting a new distinct disorder.InheritanceAs the affected boy and girl reported by O'Driscoll et al.

A mottled pigmentation was present in photoexposed areas (forearms, legs, and cheeks), and episodes of cold-triggered erythrocyanosis of the toes and fingers were noted. The older sister developed fatal diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration at the age of 5 years. The second sister developed a severe episode of diarrhea and dehydration at the age of 3 years. Although she survived this episode, she subsequently developed extraocular muscle palsy, lid ptosis, pigmentary deposits of the retina, and extinguished electroretinogram. Osteoporosis and rickets were detected as well as liver enlargement. In her fifth year, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus was found, and she gradually developed cerebellar ataxia and hypotonia with deafness, blindness, myoclonic jerks, and psychomotor regression. Death occurred at the age of 8 years. In this family the mother had gradually developed bilateral extraocular muscle palsy with lid ptosis and micropunctated tapetoretinal degeneration in early adulthood. She also developed myopia, hypoacusis, and muscle weakness after her first pregnancy. The 2 sisters described were her only children. Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of lymphocyte DNA, Rotig et al. (1992) detected minute amounts of duplicated mtDNA molecules in the mother. Skeletal muscle and lymphocytes of the younger sister had demonstrated complex III deficiency.

These episodes are often accompanied by fever and sometimes a rash or headache. Occasionally inflammation may occur in other parts of the body, such as the heart; the membrane surrounding the brain and spinal cord; and in males, the testicles. In about half of affected individuals, attacks are preceded by mild signs and symptoms known as a prodrome.

The first episode of illness in familial Mediterranean fever usually occurs in childhood or the teenage years, but in some cases, the initial attack occurs much later in life. Typically, episodes last 12 to 72 hours and can vary in severity. The length of time between attacks is also variable and can range from days to years. During these periods, affected individuals usually have no signs or symptoms related to the condition. However, without treatment to help prevent attacks and complications, a buildup of protein deposits (amyloidosis) in the body's organs and tissues may occur, especially in the kidneys, which can lead to kidney failure.

However, without treatment to help prevent attacks and complications, a buildup of protein deposits (amyloidosis) in the body's organs and tissues may occur, especially in the kidneys, which can lead to kidney failure.FrequencyFamilial Mediterranean fever primarily affects populations originating in the Mediterranean region, particularly people of Armenian, Arab, Turkish, or Jewish ancestry.The disorder affects 1 in 200 to 1,000 people in these populations.It is less common in other populations.CausesMutations in the MEFV gene cause familial Mediterranean fever. The MEFV gene provides instructions for making a protein called pyrin (also known as marenostrin), which is found in white blood cells. This protein is involved in the immune system, helping to regulate the process of inflammation. Inflammation occurs when the immune system sends signaling molecules and white blood cells to a site of injury or disease to fight microbial invaders and facilitate tissue repair. When this process is complete, the body stops the inflammatory response to prevent damage to its own cells and tissues.Mutations in the MEFV gene reduce the activity of the pyrin protein, which disrupts control of the inflammation process. An inappropriate or prolonged inflammatory response can result, leading to fever and pain in the abdomen, chest, or joints.Normal variations in the SAA1 gene may modify the course of familial Mediterranean fever. Some evidence suggests that a particular version of the SAA1 gene (called the alpha variant) increases the risk of amyloidosis among people with familial Mediterranean fever.Learn more about the genes associated with Familial Mediterranean feverMEFVSAA1Inheritance PatternFamilial Mediterranean fever is almost always inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the MEFV gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.In rare cases, this condition appears to be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. An autosomal dominant inheritance pattern describes cases in which one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In autosomal dominant inheritance, affected individuals often inherit the mutation from one affected parent.However, another mechanism is believed to account for some cases of familial Mediterranean fever that were originally thought to be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. A gene mutation that occurs frequently in a population may result in a disorder with autosomal recessive inheritance appearing in multiple generations in a family, a pattern that mimics autosomal dominant inheritance. If one parent has familial Mediterranean fever (with mutations in both copies of the MEFV gene in each cell) and the other parent is an unaffected carrier (with a mutation in one copy of the MEFV gene in each cell), it may appear as if the affected child inherited the disorder only from the affected parent. This appearance of autosomal dominant inheritance when the pattern is actually autosomal recessive is called pseudodominance.\"},\n",

       "   'text': 'DescriptionNocturnal enuresis, or nightly bedwetting in children more than 7 years of age, affects about 10% of 7-year-old children, with a wide range of frequencies between populations. The affliction is often linked to major social maladjustments and occupies considerable time in general medical practice. From the age of 7, there is a spontaneous cure rate of 15% per year, such that few remain affected after the age of 16 years. There are 2 types of nocturnal enuresis: type I, the primary form (PNE), with at least 3 nightly episodes in children older than 7 years, where the child has always had the disorder, and type II, or secondary type, where the child has been dry for at least 6 months but enuresis has recurred (summary by Eiberg et al., 1995).Genetic Heterogeneity of Nocturnal EnuresisENUR1 has been mapped to chromosome 13q, and ENUR2 has been mapped to chromosome 12q.InheritanceEiberg et al. (1995) identified 17 families with nocturnal enuresis. In 11 of these families, type I nocturnal enuresis appeared to follow an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance with penetrance above 90%.Muller (1997) observed a pair of 8-year-old monozygotic twins, only one of which suffered from nocturnal enuresis. The father, uncle, and grandfather of the twins also had nocturnal enuresis.In a Swedish multicenter study, Arnell et al. (1997) ascertained 392 children with PNE and studied the inheritance pattern of the disorder in their families. Compatible with dominant inheritance, 168 (43%) of the children had an affected parent; 37 (9.4%) had an affected sib, taken to indicate autosomal recessive inheritance. The possibility of dominant inheritance with reduced penetrance was acknowledged. In 57 cases a more distant relative with PNE was found, and in 130 cases no family history of PNE was found.MappingEiberg et al. (1995) presented strong evidence of linkage of nocturnal enuresis with the DNA markers D13S291 (lod = 3.55 at theta = 0.07) and D13S263 (lod = 2.67 at theta = 0.08). Multipoint analysis indicated that these markers flanked the disease locus at 13q13-q14.3.Arnell et al. (1997) studied sixteen 2- and 3-generation Swedish families showing a dominant pattern of inheritance of PNE. Suggestive linkage to the interval between D13S263 and D13S291 (Zmax = 2.1) was found in 3 families. Linkage to this region was excluded in 11 families. A positive 2-point lod score (Zmax = 4.2) was found in 6 families for D12S80 at theta = 0.05 (see 600808).Neuro- Nocturnal enuresis-Nightly bedwettingInheritance- Autosomal dominant (13q13-q14.3)-heterogeneous, also ENUR2 at 12q13-q21▲Close'},\n",

       "   'text': 'Postoperative nausea and vomitingSpecialtyAnesthesiaPostoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is the phenomenon of nausea, vomiting, or retching experienced by a patient in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) or within 24 hours following a surgical procedure. It is an unpleasant complication that affects about 10% of the population undergoing general anaesthesia each year.Contents1 Cause1.1 Risk factors2 Management2.1 Preoperative fasting2.2 Medications[4]2.3 Alternative medicine3 Epidemiology4 References5 Further reading6 External linksCause[edit]Emetogenic drugs commonly used in anaesthesia include nitrous oxide, physostigmine, and opioids. The intravenous anaesthetic propofol is currently the least emetogenic general anaesthetic. These medications are thought to stimulate the chemoreceptor trigger zone. This area is on the floor of the fourth ventricle and is effectively outside of the blood-brain barrier, which makes it incredibly sensitive to toxin and pharmacological stimulation. Several neurotransmitters are known, such as histamine, dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, and the more recently discovered neurokinin-1 (substance P).Risk factors[edit]A 2008 study compared 121 Japanese patients who experienced PONV after being given the general anesthetic propofol to 790 people who were free of postoperative nausea after receiving it. Those with a G at both copies of rs1800497 were 1.6 times more likely to experience PONV within six hours of surgery compared to those with the AG or AA genotypes, but they were not significantly more likely to experience PONV more than six hours after surgery.[1]PONV results from patient, surgical, and anesthetic factors.Surgical factors that confer increased risk for PONV include procedures of increased length and gynecological, abdominal, laparoscopicand ENT procedures, and strabismus procedures in children.Anesthetic risk factors include the use of volatile anesthetics, nitrous oxide (N2O), opioids, and longer duration of anesthesia.Patient factors that confer increased risk for PONV include female gender, obesity, age less than 16 years, past history of motion sickness or chemotherapy-induced nausea, high levels of preoperative anxiety, and patients with history of PONV.Smokers and the elderly often have a decreased risk for PONV.A risk-stratification method created by Apfel et al has been developed to determine a patient\\'s risk for PONV. The presence of 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 of any of the following risk factors corresponds to a PONV respective risk of 10, 20, 40, 60, and 80%.[2]- Female gender- Non-smoking- History of PONV or motion sickness- Expectant use of postoperative opioid medicationsManagement[edit]Becausecurrently no single antiemetic available is especially effective on its own, experts recommend a multimodal approach. Anesthetic strategies to prevent vomiting include using regional anesthesia whenever possible and avoiding medications that cause vomiting. Medications to treat and prevent PONV are limited by both cost and the adverse effects. People with risk factors likely warrant preventive medication, whereas a \"wait and see\" strategy is appropriate for those without risk factors.Preoperative fasting[edit]Fasting guidelines often restrict the intake of any oral fluid 2-6 hours preoperatively, but in a large retrospective analysis in Torbay Hospital, unrestricted clear oral fluids until transfer to theatre could significantly reduce the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting without an increased risk in the adverse outcomes for which such conservative guidance exists.[3]Medications[4][edit]A multimodal approach to treating a patient with PONV can be efficacious. Numerous patient factors and medication adverse effects must be taken into consideration when selecting a treatment regimen.Serotonin (5-HT3) receptor antagonists can be administered as a single dose at the end of surgery. Adverse effects include prolongation of the QT interval on electrocardiogram (EKG). Medications include ondansetron, granisetron, and dolasetron.Anticholinergics can be used as a long-acting patch placed behind the patient\\'s ear. Adverse effects include dry mouth and blurry vision. Care must be taken when handling the patch, as transfer of medication to the eye can induce pupillary dilation. Avoid use in elderly patients. Medications include scopolamine.Glucocorticoids have direct antiemetic effects and can reduce need for postoperative opioids. Adverse effects include a transient increase in serum glucose level, and poor wound healing (controversial).Medications include dexamethasone.Butyrophenones are typically administered as a single injection at the end of surgery. Adverse effects include prolongation of the QT interval on EKG.Medications include droperidol and haloperidol.Phenothiazines are particularly effective in treating opioid-induced PONV. Adverse effects are dose-dependent and include sedation and extrapyramidal symptoms.Medications include promethazine and prochlorperazine.Neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor antagonists prevent an emetic signal from being transmitted.Medications include aprepitant and rolapitant.Histamine receptor antagonists can be administered by multiple routes, including orally, intramuscularly, or rectally. Adverse effects include dry mouth, sedation, and urinary retention.Medications include dimenhydrinate and diphenhydramine.Propofol, an anesthetic medication, confers its own antiemetic properties.Alternative medicine[edit]In conjunction with antiemetic medications, at least one study has found that application to the pericardium meridian 6 acupressure point produced a positive effect in relieving PONV.[5] Another study found no statistically significant difference.[6] The two general types of alternative pressure therapy are sham acupressure and the use of the P6 point. A 2015 study foundno significant difference between the use of either therapy in the treatment or prevention of PONV. In a review of 59 studies, both therapies significantly affected the nausea aspect, but had no significant effect on vomiting.Cannabinoids have also been used for treatment of PONV, but its safety and efficacy are controversial.Epidemiology[edit]Typically, the incidence of nausea or vomiting after general anesthesia ranges between 25 and 30%.[7] Nausea and vomiting can be extremely distressing for patients, and so is one of their major concerns.[8] Vomiting has been associated with major complications, such as pulmonary aspiration of gastric content, and might endanger surgical outcomes after certain procedures, for example after maxillofacial surgery with wired jaws. Nausea and vomiting can delay discharge, and about 1% of patients scheduled for day surgery require unanticipated overnight admission because of uncontrolled PONV.References[edit]^ [1]^ Apfel CC, Läärä E, Koivuranta M, et al.

       "   'text': 'DientamoebiasisSpecialtyInfectious diseaseDientamoebiasis is a medical condition caused by infection with Dientamoeba fragilis, a single-cell parasite that infects the lower gastrointestinal tract of humans. It is an important cause of traveler\\'s diarrhea, chronic abdominal pain, chronic fatigue,[citation needed] and failure to thrive in children.Contents1 Signs and symptoms2 Cause2.1 Genetic diversity2.2 Transmission3 Diagnosis4 Treatment5 Epidemiology6 History7 See also8 References9 External linksSigns and symptoms[edit]The most commonly reported symptoms in conjunction with infection with D. fragilis include abdominal pain (69%) and diarrhea (61%).[1] Diarrhea may be intermittent and may not be present in all cases. It is often chronic, lasting over two weeks. The degree of symptoms may vary from asymptomatic to severe,[2] and can include weight loss, vomiting, fever, and involvement of other digestive organs.Symptoms may be more severe in children. Additional symptoms reported have included:[3]Weight lossFatigueNausea and vomitingFeverUrticaria (skin rash)Pruritus (itchiness)Biliary infectionCause[edit]Genetic diversity[edit]As many individuals are asymptomatic carriers of D. fragilis,pathogenic and nonpathogenic variants are proposed to exist. A study of D. fragilis isolates from 60 individuals with symptomatic infection in Sydney, Australia, found all were infected with the same genotype,[4] which is the most common worldwide, but differed from the genotype first described from a North American isolate and later also detected in Europe.[5]Transmission[edit]Organisms similar to D. fragilis are known to produce a cyst stage that is able to survive outside the host and facilitate infection of new hosts. However, the exact manner in which it is transmitted is not yet known, as the organism is unable to survive outside its human host for more than a few hours after excretion, and no cyst stage has been found.[6]Early theories of transmission suggestedD. fragilis was unable to produce a cyst stage in infected humans, but some animal existed that in which it did produce a cyst stage, and this animal was responsible for spreading it. However, no such animal has ever been discovered.[3] A later theory suggested the organism was transmitted by pinworms, which provided protection for the parasite outside the host. DNA has been detected in surface-sterilized eggs of Enterobius vermicularis eggs, thus suggesting the latter may harbor the former.[7] Experimental ingestion ofpinworm eggs established infection in two investigators. Numerous studies reported high rates of coinfection with helminthes.[8] However, recent study has failed to show any association between D. fragilis infection and pinworm infection. Parasites similar to D. fragilis are transmitted by consuming water or food contaminated with feces.[6] The high rate (40%) of concomitant infection with other protozoa reported by at St. Vincent\\'s Hospital, Sydney, Australia, supports the oral-fecal route of transmission.Diagnosis[edit]Diagnosis is usually performed by submitting multiple stool samples for examination by a parasitologist in a procedure known as an ova and parasite examination. About 30% of children with D. fragilis infection exhibit peripheral blood eosinophilia.[citation needed]A minimum of three stool specimens having been immediately fixed in polyvinyl alcohol fixative, sodium acetate-acetic acid-formalin fixative, or Schaudinn\\'s fixative should be submitted, as the protozoan does not remain morphologically identifiable for long. All specimens, regardless of consistency, are permanently stained prior to microscopic examination with an oil immersion lens. The disease may remain cryptic due to the lack of a cyst stage if these recommendations are not followed.[9]The trophozoite forms have been recovered from formed stool, thus the need to perform the ova and parasite examination on specimens other than liquid or soft stools. DNA fragment analysis provides excellent sensitivity and specificity when compared to microscopy for the detection of D. fragilis and both methods should be employed in laboratories with PCR capability. The most sensitive detection method is parasite culture, and the culture medium requires the addition of rice starch.An indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) for fixed stool specimens has been developed.One researcher investigated the phenomenon of symptomatic relapse following treatment of infection with D. fragilis in association with its apparent disappearance from stool samples. The organism could still be detected in patients through colonoscopy or by examining stool samples taken in conjunction with a saline laxative.[10]A study found that trichrome staining, a traditional method for identification, had a sensitivity of 36% (9/25) when compared to stool culture.[11]An additional study found that the sensitivity of staining was 50% (2/4), and that the organism could be successfully cultured in stool specimens up to 12-hours old that were kept at room temperature.[12]Treatment[edit]Concomitant pinworm infection should also be excluded, although the association has not been proven.Successful treatment of the infection with iodoquinol, doxycycline, metronidazole, paromomycin, and secnidazole has been reported.[3][2] Resistance requires the use of combination therapy to eradicate the organism. All persons living in the same residence should be screened for D. fragilis, as asymptomatic carriers may provide a source of repeated infection. Paromomycin is an effective prophylactic for travellers who will encounter poor sanitation and unsafe drinking water.[citation needed]Epidemiology[edit]Rates of infection increase in conditions of crowding and poor sanitation, and are higher in military personnel and mental institutions.The true extent of disease has yet to emerge, as most laboratories do not use techniques to adequately identify this organism. An Australian study identified a large number of patients, considered to have irritable bowel syndrome, who were actually infected with Dientamoeba fragilis.[13]Although D. fragilis has been described as an infection \"emerging from obscurity\",[3] it has become one of the most prevalent gastrointestinal infections in industrialized countries, especially among children and young adults. A Canadian study reported a prevalence of around 10% in boys and girls aged 11–15 years,[6] a prevalence of 11.5% in individuals aged 16–20, and a lower incidence of 0.3–1.9% in individuals over age 20.History[edit]Early microbiologists reported that the organism was not pathogenic,though six of the seven individuals from whom they isolated it were experiencing symptoms of dysentery. Their report, published in 1918, concluded the organism was not pathogenic because it consumed bacteria in culture, but did not appear to engulf red blood cells, as was seen in the best-known disease-causing amoeba of the time, Entamoeba histolytica. This initial report may still be contributing to the reluctance of physicians to diagnose the infection.[3]See also[edit]List of parasites (human)References[edit]^ .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}Vandenberg O, Peek R, Souayah H,etal.

This change is causing diagnostic shift in the mortality data.[17] In addition, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recently proposed that such deaths be called \"sudden unexpected infant deaths\" (SUID) and that SIDS is a subset of SUID.[18]Age[edit]SIDS has a 4-parameter lognormal age distribution that spares infants shortly after birth — the time of maximal risk for almost all other causes of non-trauma infant death.By definition, SIDS deaths occur under the age of one year, with the peak incidence occurring when the infant is at 2 to 4 months of age. This is considered a critical period because the infant\\'s ability to rouse from sleep is not yet mature.[2]Risk factors[edit]The cause of SIDS is unknown.[3] Although studies have identified risk factors for SIDS, such as putting infants to bed on their stomachs, there has been little understanding of the syndrome\\'s biological process or its potential causes. Deaths from SIDS are unlikely to be due to a single cause, but rather multiple risk factors.[19] The frequency of SIDS does appear to be influenced by social, economic, and cultural factors, such as maternal education, race or ethnicity, and poverty.[20] SIDS is believed to occur when an infant with an underlying biological vulnerability, who is at a critical development age, is exposed to an external trigger.[2] The following risk factors generally contribute either to the underlying biological vulnerability or represent an external trigger:Tobacco smoke[edit]SIDS rates are higher in babies of mothers who smoke during pregnancy.[21][22] Between no smoking and smoking 1 cigarette a day, on average, the risk doubles. About 22% of SIDS in the United States is related to mother\\'s smoking.[23] SIDS correlates with levels of nicotine and derivatives in the baby.[24] Nicotine and derivatives cause alterations in neurodevelopment.[25]Sleeping[edit]Placing an infant to sleep while lying on the stomach or side rather than on their back increases the risk.[5][26] This increased risk is greatest at two to three months of age.[5] Elevated or reduced room temperature also increases the risk,[27] as does excessive bedding, clothing, soft sleep surfaces, and stuffed animals.[28] Bumper pads may increase the risk of SIDS due to the risk of suffocation. They are not recommended for children under one year of age as this risk of suffocation greatly outweighs the risk of head bumping or limbs getting stuck in the bars of the crib.[5]Sharing a bed with parents or siblings increases the risk for SIDS.[29] This risk is greatest in the first three months of life, when the mattress is soft, when one or more persons share the infant\\'s bed, especially when the bed partners are using drugs or alcohol or are smoking.[5] The risk remains, however, even in parents who do not smoke or use drugs.[30] The American Academy of Pediatrics thus recommends \"room-sharing without bed-sharing\", stating that such an arrangement can decrease the risk of SIDS by up to 50%. Furthermore, the Academy recommended against devices marketed to make bed-sharing \"safe\", such as in-bed co-sleepers.[31]Room sharing as opposed to solitary sleeping is known to decrease the risk of SIDS.[32]Breastfeeding[edit]Breastfeeding is associated with a lower risk of SIDS.[33] It is not clear if co-sleeping among mothers who breastfeed without any other risk factors increases SIDS risk.[34]Pregnancy and infant factors[edit]SIDS rates decrease with increasing maternal age, with teenage mothers at greatest risk.[21] Delayed or inadequate prenatal care also increases risk.[21] Low birth weight is a significant risk factor. In the United States from 1995 to 1998, the SIDS death rate for infants weighing 1000–1499 g was 2.89/1000, while for a birth weight of 3500–3999 g, it was only 0.51/1000.[35][36] Premature birth increases the risk of SIDS death roughly fourfold.[21][35] From 1995 to 1998, the U.S. SIDS rate for births at 37–39 weeks of gestation was 0.73/1000, while the SIDS rate for births at 28–31 weeks of gestation was 2.39/1000.[35]Anemia has also been linked to SIDS[37] (note, however, that per item 6 in the list of epidemiologic characteristics below, extent of anemia cannot be evaluated at autopsy because an infant\\'s total hemoglobin can only be measured during life.[38]). SIDS incidence rises from zero at birth, is highest from two to four months of age, and declines toward zero after the infant\\'s first year.[39]Genetics[edit]Genetics plays a role, as SIDS is more prevalent in males.[40][41]There is a consistent 50% male excess in SIDS per 1000 live births of each sex. Given a 5% male excess birth rate, there appears to be 3.15 male SIDS cases per 2 female, for a male fraction of 0.61.[40][41] This value of 61% in the US is an average of 57% black male SIDS, 62.2% white male SIDS and 59.4% for all other races combined. Note that when multiracial parentage is involved, infant race is arbitrarily assigned to one category or the other; most often it is chosen by the mother. The X-linkage hypothesis for SIDS and the male excess in infant mortality have shown that the 50% male excess could be related to a dominant X-linked allele, occurring with a frequency of \\u200b1⁄3 that is protective of transient cerebral anoxia. An unprotected male would occur with a frequency of \\u200b2⁄3 and an unprotected female would occur with a frequency of \\u200b4⁄9.About 10 to 20% of SIDS cases are believed to be due to channelopathies, which are inherited defects in the ion channels which play an important role in the contraction of the heart.[42]Alcohol[edit]Drinking of alcohol by parents is linked to SIDS.[43] One study found a positive correlation between the two during New Years celebrations and weekends.[44] Another found that alcohol use disorder was linked to a more than twofold risk.[45]Other[edit]There is a tentative link with Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli.[46] Vaccinations do not increase the risk of SIDS. Vaccines are linked to a 50% lower risk of SIDS.[47][48]SIDS has been linked to cold weather with this association believed to be due to over bundling and thus overheating.[49] Premature babies are at four times the risk of SIDS, possibly related to an underdeveloped ability to control the cardiovascular system [50]A 1998 report found that antimony- and phosphorus-containing compounds used as fire retardants in PVC and other cot mattress materials are not a cause of SIDS.[51] The report also states that toxic gas cannot be generated from antimony in mattresses and that babies suffered SIDS on mattresses that did not contain the compound.Diagnosis[edit]Differential diagnosis[edit]Some conditions that are often undiagnosed and could be confused with or comorbid with SIDS include:medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency (MCAD deficiency);[52]infant botulism;[53]long QT syndrome (accounting for less than 2% of cases);[54]Helicobacter pylori bacterial infections;[55]shaken baby syndrome and other forms of child abuse;[56][57]overlaying, child smothering during carer\\'s sleep[58]For example, an infant with MCAD deficiency could have died by \"classical SIDS\" if found swaddled and prone with head covered in an overheated room where parents were smoking. Genes indicating susceptibility to MCAD and Long QT syndrome do not protect an infant from dying of classical SIDS. Therefore, presence of a susceptibility gene, such as for MCAD, means the infant may have died either from SIDS or from MCAD deficiency. It is currently impossible for the pathologist to distinguish between them.A 2010 study looked at 554 autopsies of infants in North Carolina that listed SIDS as the cause of death, and suggested that many of these deaths may have been due to accidental suffocation.The study found that 69% of autopsies listed other possible risk factors that could have led to death, such as unsafe bedding or sleeping with adults.[59]Several instances of infanticide have been uncovered where the diagnosis was originally SIDS.[60][61] Estimate of the percentage of SIDS deaths that are actually infanticide vary from less than 1% to up to 5% of cases.[62]Some have underestimated the risk of two SIDS deaths occurring in the same family and the Royal Statistical Society issued a media release refuting this expert testimony in one UK case in which the conviction was subsequently overturned.[63]Prevention[edit]A number of measures have been found to be effective in preventing SIDS including changing the sleeping position, breastfeeding, limiting soft bedding, immunizing the infant and using pacifiers.[5][64] The use of electronic monitors has not been found to be useful as a preventative strategy.[5] The effect that fans might have on the risk of SIDS has not been studied well enough to make any recommendation about them.[5] Evidence regarding swaddling is unclear regarding SIDS.[5] A 2016 review found tentative evidence that swaddling increases risk of SIDS, especially among babies placed on their stomachs or side while sleeping.[65]Measures not shown to be useful include positioning devices and baby monitors.[5][6] Companies that sell the monitors do not have FDA approval for them as a medical device.[66]Sleep positioning[edit]SIDS rate from 1988 to 2006Sleeping on the back has been found to reduce the risk of SIDS.[67] It is thus recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics and promoted as a best practice by the US National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) \"Safe to Sleep\" campaign. The incidence of SIDS has fallen in a number of countries in which this recommendation has been widely adopted.[68] Sleeping on the back does not appear to increase the risk of choking even in those with gastroesophageal reflux disease.[5] While infants in this position may sleep more lightly this is not harmful.[5] Sharing the same room as one\\'s parents but in a different bed may decrease the risk by half.[5]Pacifiers[edit]The use of pacifiers appears to decrease the risk of SIDS although the reason is unclear.[5] The American Academy of Pediatrics considers pacifier use to prevent SIDS to be reasonable.[5] Pacifiers do not appear to affect breastfeeding in the first four months, even though this is a common misconception.[69]Bedding[edit]Product safety experts advise against using pillows, overly soft mattresses, sleep positioners, bumper pads (crib bumpers), stuffed animals, or fluffy bedding in the crib and recommend instead dressing the child warmly and keeping the crib \"naked.\"[70]Blankets or other clothing should not be placed over a baby\\'s head.[71]The use of a \"baby sleep bag\" or \"sleep sack\", a soft bag with holes for the baby\\'s arms and head can be used as a type of bedding that warms the baby without covering its head.[72]Vaccination[edit]Higher rates of DTP immunization is associated with lower rates of SIDS supporting recommendations on timely DTP immunization.[73]Many other studies have also reached conclusions that vaccinations reduce the risk of SIDS. Studies generally show that SIDS risk is approximately halved by vaccinations.[74][75][47][76][77]Management[edit]Families who are impacted by SIDS may be offered emotional support and grief counseling.[78] The experience and manifestation of grief at the loss of an infant are impacted by cultural and individual differences.[79]Epidemiology[edit]Globally SIDS resulted in about 22,000 deaths as of 2010[update], down from 30,000 deaths in 1990.[80] Rates vary significantly by population from 0.05 per 1000 in Hong Kong to 6.7 per 1000 in Native Americans.[81]SIDS was responsible for 0.54 deaths per 1,000 live births in the US in 2005.[35] It is responsible for far fewer deaths than congenital disorders and disorders related to short gestation, though it is the leading cause of death in healthy infants after one month of age.SIDS deaths in the US decreased from 4,895 in 1992 to 2,247 in 2004.[82] But, during a similar time period, 1989 to 2004, SIDS being listed as the cause of death for sudden infant death (SID) decreased from 80% to 55%.[82] According to John Kattwinkel, chairman of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Special Task Force on SIDS \"A lot of us are concerned that the rate (of SIDS) isn\\'t decreasing significantly, but that a lot of it is just code shifting\".[82]Race[edit]Rates of SIDS by race/ethnicity in the U.S., 2009, CDC, 2013In 2013, there are persistent disparities in SIDS deaths among racial and ethnic groups in the U.S. In 2009, the rates of death range from 20.3 per 100,000 live births for Asian/Pacific Islander to 119.2 per 100,000 live births for Native Americans/Alaska Native. African American infants have a 24% greater risk of having a SIDS related death[83] and experience a 2.5 greater incidence of SIDS than in Caucasian infants.[84] Rates are per 100,000 live births and enable more accurate comparison across groups of different total population size.Research suggests that factors which contribute more directly to SIDS risk—maternal age, exposure to smoking, safe sleep practices, etc.—vary by racial and ethnic group and therefore risk exposure also varies by these groups.[2] Risk factors associated with prone sleeping patterns of African American families include mother\\'s age, household poverty index, rural/urban status of residence, and infant\\'s age. More than 50% of African American infants were placed in non-recommended sleeping positions according to a study completed in South Carolina.[85] Cultural factors can be protective as well as problematic.[86]The rate per 1000 births varies in different ethnic groups in the United States:[27][87]Central Americans and South Americans: 0.20Asian/Pacific Islanders: 0.28Mexicans: 0.24Puerto Ricans: 0.53Whites: 0.51African Americans: 1.08Native American: 1.24Society and culture[edit]This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it.(November 2020)The rate of SIDS varies vastly in different cultures and countries around the globe with SIDS rates lowest among Asian and Pacific Islander infants. Some evidence supports the hypothesis that SIDS is not an ancient phenomenom and that it appears more commonly in western societies.Much of the media portrayal of infants shows them in non-recommended sleeping positions.[5]See also[edit].mw-parser-output .portal{border:solid #aaa 1px;padding:0}.mw-parser-output .portal.tleft{margin:0.5em 1em 0.5em 0}.mw-parser-output .portal.tright{margin:0.5em 0 0.5em 1em}.mw-parser-output .portal>ul{display:table;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0.1em;max-width:175px;background:#f9f9f9;font-size:85%;line-height:110%;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold}.mw-parser-output .portal>ul>li{display:table-row}.mw-parser-output .portal>ul>li>span:first-child{display:table-cell;padding:0.2em;vertical-align:middle;text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .portal>ul>li>span:last-child{display:table-cell;padding:0.2em 0.2em 0.2em 0.3em;vertical-align:middle}Medicine portalNewborn care and safetySudden unexpected death syndromeSudden unexplained death in childhoodReferences[edit]^ a b c d .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}\"Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS): Overview\".

The time between infection and symptoms, in those who develop them, is between 2 and 6 weeks with an average of 28 days.[2]The risk for symptomatic infection is directly related to age, with more than 80% of adults having symptoms compatible with acute viral hepatitis and the majority of children having either asymptomatic or unrecognized infections.[12]Symptoms usually last less than 2 months, although some people can be ill for as long as 6 months:[13]FatigueFeverNauseaAppetite lossJaundice, a yellowing of the skin or the whites of the eyes owing to hyperbilirubinemiaBile is removed from the bloodstream and excreted in the urine, giving it a dark amber colorDiarrheaLight, or clay-colored faeces (acholic faeces)Abdominal discomfort[14]Extrahepatic manifestations[edit]Joint pains, red cell aplasia, pancreatitis and generalized lymphadenopathy are the possible extrahepatic manifestations. Kidney failure and pericarditis are very uncommon.[15] If they occur, they show an acute onset and disappear upon resolution of the disease.Virology[edit]Hepatovirus AElectron micrograph of Hepatovirus A virionsVirus classification (unranked):VirusRealm:RiboviriaKingdom:OrthornaviraePhylum:PisuviricotaClass:PisoniviricetesOrder:PicornaviralesFamily:PicornaviridaeGenus:HepatovirusSpecies:Hepatovirus ASynonymsHepatitis A virus[16]Human hepatitis A virus[17]Simian hepatitis A virus[17]Taxonomy[edit]Hepatovirus A is a species of virus in the order Picornavirales in the family Picornaviridae and is the type species of the genus Hepatovirus. Humans and other vertebrates serve as natural hosts.[18][19]A total of nine members of Hepatovirus are recognized.[20] These species infect bats, rodents, hedgehogs, and shrews. Phylogenetic analysis suggests a rodent origin for Hepatitis A.A member virus of Hepatovirus B (Phopivirus) has been isolated from a seal.[21][22] This virus shared a common ancestor with Hepatovirus A about 1800 years ago.Another hepatovirus - Marmota himalayana hepatovirus - has been isolated from the woodchuck Marmota himalayana.[23] This virus appears to have had a common ancestor with the primate-infecting species around 1000 years ago.Genotypes[edit]One serotype and seven different genetic groups (four human and three simian) have been described.[24] The human genotypes are numbered I–III. Six subtypes have been described (IA, IB, IIA, IIB, IIIA, IIIB). The simian genotypes have been numbered IV–VI. A single isolate of genotype VII isolated from a human has also been described.[25] Genotype III has been isolated from both humans and owl monkeys. Most human isolates are of genotype I.[26] Of the type I isolates subtype IA accounts for the majority.The mutation rate in the genome has been estimated to be 1.73–9.76 × 10−4 nucleotide substitutions per site per year.[27][28] The human strains appear to have diverged from the simian about 3600 years ago.[28] The mean age of genotypes III and IIIA strains has been estimated to be 592 and 202 years, respectively.[28]Structure[edit]Hepatovirus A is a picornavirus; it is not enveloped and contains a single-stranded RNA packaged in a protein shell.[24] Only one serotype of the virus has been found, but multiple genotypes exist.[29] Codon use within the genome is biased and unusually distinct from its host. It also has a poor internal ribosome entry site.[30] In the region that codes for the HAV capsid, highly conserved clusters of rare codons restrict antigenic variability.[18][31]GenusStructureSymmetryCapsidGenomic arrangementGenomic segmentationHepatovirusIcosahedralPseudo T=3NonenvelopedLinearMonopartiteReplication cycle[edit]Vertebrates such as humans serve as the natural hosts. Transmission routes are fecal-oral and blood.[18]Following ingestion, HAV enters the bloodstream through the epitheliumof the oropharynx or intestine.[32]The blood carries the virus to its target, the liver, where it multiplies within hepatocytes and Kupffer cells (liver macrophages). Viral replication is cytoplasmic. Entry into the host cell is achieved by attachment of the virus to host receptors, which mediates endocytosis. Replication follows the positive-stranded RNA virus replication model. Translation takes place by viral initiation. The virus exits the host cell by lysis andviroporins. Virions are secreted into the bile and released in stool. HAV isexcreted in large numbers about 11 days prior to the appearanceof symptoms or anti-HAVIgM antibodies in the blood. The incubation periodis 15–50 days and risk of death in those infected is less than 0.5%.Within the liver hepatocytes, the RNA genome is released from the protein coat and is translated by the cell\\'s own ribosomes. Unlike other picornaviruses, this virus requires an intact eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) for the initiation of translation.[33] The requirement for this factor results in an inability to shut down host protein synthesis, unlike other picornaviruses. The virus must then inefficiently compete for the cellular translational machinery, which may explain its poor growth in cell culture. Presumably for this reason, the virus has strategically adopted a naturally highly deoptimized codon usage with respect to that of its cellular host. Precisely how this strategy works is not quite clear yet.No apparent virus-mediated cytotoxicity occurs, presumably because of the virus\\' own requirement for an intact eIF4G, and liver pathology is likely immune-mediated.GenusHost detailsTissue tropismEntry detailsRelease detailsReplication siteAssembly siteTransmissionHepatovirusHumans; vertebratesLiverCell receptor endocytosisLysisCytoplasmCytoplasmOral-fecal; bloodTransmission[edit]The virus spreads by the fecal–oral route, and infections often occur in conditions of poor sanitation and overcrowding. Hepatitis A can be transmitted by the parenteral route, but very rarely by blood and blood products. Food-borne outbreaks are common,[34] and ingestion of shellfish cultivated in polluted water is associated with a high risk of infection.[35]About 40% of all acute viral hepatitis is caused by HAV.[32]Infected individuals are infectious prior to onset of symptoms, roughly 10 days following infection.The virus is resistant to detergent, acid (pH 1), solvents (e.g., ether, chloroform), drying, and temperatures up to 60°C.It can survive for months in fresh and salt water.Common-source (e.g., water, restaurant) outbreaks are typical.Infection is common in children in developing countries, reaching 100% incidence, but following infection, lifelong immunity results.HAV can be inactivated by chlorine treatment (drinking water), formalin (0.35%, 37°C, 72 hours), peracetic acid (2%, 4 hours), beta-propiolactone (0.25%, 1 hour), and UV radiation (2 μW/cm2/min). HAV can also be spread sexual contact specifically oroanal sexual acts.In developing countries, and in regions with poor hygiene standards, the rates of infection with this virus are high[36] and the illness is usually contracted in early childhood. As incomes rise and access to clean water increases, the incidence of HAV decreases.[37] In developed countries, though, the infection is contracted primarily by susceptible young adults, most of whom are infected with the virus during trips to countries with a high incidence of the disease[2] or through contact with infectious persons.Humans are the only natural reservoir of the virus. No known insect or other animal vectors can transmit the virus. A chronic HAV state has not been reported.[38]Diagnosis[edit]Serum IgG, IgM, and ALT following hepatovirus A infectionAlthough HAV is excreted in the feces towards the end of the incubation period, specific diagnosis is made by the detection of HAV-specific IgM antibodies in the blood.[39] IgM antibody is only present in the blood following an acute hepatitis A infection. It is detectable from 1–2 weeks after the initial infection and persists for up to 14 weeks. The presence of IgG antibodies in the blood means the acute stage of the illness has passed and the person is immune to further infection. IgG antibodies to HAV are also found in the blood following vaccination, and tests for immunity to the virus are based on the detection of these antibodies.[39]During the acute stage of the infection, the liver enzyme alanine transferase (ALT) is present in the blood at levels much higher than is normal. The enzyme comes from the liver cells damaged by the virus.[40]Hepatovirus A is present in the blood (viremia) and feces of infected people up to 2 weeks before clinical illness develops.[40]Prevention[edit]For information about the vaccine, its properties, and its application, see Hepatitis A vaccine.Hepatitis A can be prevented by vaccination, good hygiene, and sanitation.[6][41]Vaccination[edit]The two types of vaccines contain either inactivated Hepatovirus A or a live but attenuated virus.[3] Both provide active immunity against a future infection. The vaccine protects against HAV in more than 95% of cases for longer than 25 years.[42] In the US, the vaccine was first used in 1996 for children in high-risk areas, and in 1999 it was spread to areas with elevating levels of infection.[43]The vaccine is given by injection.An initial dose provides protection lasting one year starting 2–4 weeks after vaccination; the second booster dose, given six to 12 months later, provides protection for over 20 years.[43]The vaccine was introduced in 1992 and was initially recommended for persons at high risk. Since then, Bahrain and Israel have embarked on elimination programmes.[44] Australia, China, Belarus, Italy, Spain, and the United States have started similar programmes. The incidence of hepatitis A where widespread vaccination has been practised has decreased dramatically. In China and the United States, the incidence of hepatitis A has decreased by 90% since 1990.[45][46]In the United States, vaccination of children is recommended at 1 and 2 years of age;[1] hepatitis A vaccination is not recommended in those younger than 12 months of age.[47] It is also recommended in those who have not been previously immunized and who have been exposed or are likely to be exposed due to travel.[1] The CDC recommends vaccination against infection for men who have sex with men.[48]Treatment[edit]No specific treatment for hepatitis A is known. Recovery from symptoms following infection may take several weeks or months. Therapy is aimed at maintaining comfort and adequate nutritional balance, including replacement of fluids lost from vomiting and diarrhea.[14]Prognosis[edit]In the United States in 1991, the mortality rate forhepatitis A was estimated to be 0.015% for the general population, but ranged up to 1.8 -2.1% for those aged 50 and over who were hospitalized with icteric hepatitis.[49] The risk of death from acute liver failure following HAV infection increases with age and when the person has underlying chronic liver disease.Young children who are infected with hepatitis A typically have a milder form of the disease, usually lasting 1–3 weeks, whereas adults tend to experience a much more severe form of the disease.[34]Epidemiology[edit]Hepatitis A distribution 2005 .mw-parser-output .legend{page-break-inside:avoid;break-inside:avoid-column}.mw-parser-output .legend-color{display:inline-block;min-width:1.25em;height:1.25em;line-height:1.25;margin:1px 0;text-align:center;border:1px solid black;background-color:transparent;color:black}.mw-parser-output .legend-text{}High: prevalence higher than 8% Intermediate: between 2% and 7% Low: less than 2%Globally, symptomatic HAV infections are believed to occur in around 1.4 million people a year.[1] About 114 million infections (asymptomatic and symptomatic) occurred all together in 2015.[4] Acute hepatitis A resulted in 11,200 deaths in 2015.[5] Developed countries have low circulating levels of hepatovirus A, while developing countries have higher levels of circulation.[50] Most adolescents and adults in developing countries have already had the disease, thus are immune.[50] Adults in midlevel countries may be at risk of disease with the potential of being exposed.[50]Countries[edit]Over 30,000 cases of hepatitis A were reported to the CDC in the US in 1997, but the number has since dropped to less than 2,000 cases reported per year.[51]The most widespread hepatitis A outbreak in the United States occurred in 2018, in the state of Kentucky. The outbreak is believed to have started in November 2017.[52] By July 2018 48% of the state\\'s counties had reported at least one case of hepatitis A, and the total number of suspected cases was 969 with six deaths (482 cases in Louisville, Kentucky).[53] By July 2019 the outbreak had reached 5,000 cases and 60 deaths, but had slowed to just a few new cases per month.[52]Another widespread outbreak in the United States, the 2003 US hepatitis outbreak, affected at least 640 people (killing four) in northeastern Ohio and southwestern Pennsylvania in late 2003. The outbreak was blamed on tainted green onions at a restaurant in Monaca, Pennsylvania.[54][55] In 1988, more than 300,000 people in Shanghai, China, were infected with HAV after eating clams (Anadara subcrenata) from a contaminated river.[32]In June 2013, frozen berries sold by US retailer Costco and purchased by around 240,000 people were the subject of a recall, after at least 158 people were infected with HAV, 69 of whom were hospitalized.[56][57] In April 2016, frozen berries sold by Costco were once again the subject of a recall, after at least 13 people in Canada were infected with HAV, three of whom were hospitalized.[58] In Australia in February 2015, a recall of frozen berries was issued after at least 19 people contracted the illness following their consumption of the product.[59] In 2017, California (particularly around San Diego), Michigan, and Utah reported outbreaks of hepatitis A that have led to over 800 hospitalizations and 40 deaths.[60][61][62]References[edit]^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}Matheny, SC; Kingery, JE (1 December 2012). \"Hepatitis A.\" Am Fam Physician. 86 (11): 1027–34, quiz 1010–1012.

Symptoms are meningitis-like and include headache, fever, nausea, vomiting, a stiff neck, confusion, hallucinations and seizures.[5] Symptoms progress rapidly over around five days, and death usually results within one to two weeks of symptoms.[5][6]N. fowleri is typically found in warm bodies of fresh water, such as ponds, lakes, rivers and hot springs. It is also found in an amoeboid or temporary flagellate stage in soil, poorly maintained municipal water supplies, water heaters, near warm-water discharges of industrial plants and in poorly chlorinated or unchlorinated swimming pools. There is no evidence of it living in salt water. As the disease is rare, it is often not considered during diagnosis.Although infection occurs very rarely,[6] it almost inevitably results in death.[7][8] Of the 450 or so naegleriasis cases in the past 60 years, only seven have survived,[9] implying a case fatality rate of 98.5%..mw-parser-output .toclimit-2 .toclevel-1 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-3 .toclevel-2 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-4 .toclevel-3 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-5 .toclevel-4 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-6 .toclevel-5 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-7 .toclevel-6 ul{display:none}Contents1 Signs and symptoms2 Cause3 Pathogenesis4 Diagnosis5 Prevention6 Treatment7 Prognosis8 Epidemiology9 History10 Society and culture11 Research12 See also13 References14 External linksSigns and symptoms[edit]Onset of symptoms begins one to nine days following exposure (with an average of five).[5] Initial symptoms include changes in taste and smell, headache, fever, nausea, vomiting, back pain,[10] and a stiff neck. Secondary symptoms are also meningitis-like including confusion, hallucinations, lack of attention, ataxia, cramp and seizures. After the start of symptoms, the disease progresses rapidly over three to seven days, with death usually occurring anywhere from seven to fourteen days later,[11] although it can take longer. In 2013, a man in Taiwan died 25 days after being infected by Naegleria fowleri.[12]It affects healthy children or young adults who have recently been exposed to bodies of fresh water.[2] Some people have presented with a clinical triad of edematous brain lesions, immune suppression and fever.[13] Scientists speculate that lower age groups are at a higher risk of contracting the disease because adolescents have a more underdeveloped and porous cribriform plate, an organ which the amoeba travels through to reach the brain.[4]Cause[edit]Naegleria fowleri\\'s human eye-like structureN. fowleri invades the central nervous system via the nose, specifically through the olfactory mucosa of the nasal tissues. This usually occurs as the result of the introduction of water that has been contaminated with N. fowleri into the nose during activities such as swimming, bathing or nasal irrigation.[14]The amoeba follows the olfactory nerve fibers through the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone into the skull. There, it migrates to the olfactory bulbs and subsequently other regions of the brain, where it feeds on the nerve tissue. The organism then begins to consume cells of the brain, piecemeal, by means of an amoebostome, a unique actin-rich sucking apparatus extended from its cell surface.[15] It then becomes pathogenic, causing primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM or PAME).Primary amebic meningoencephalitis presents symptoms similar to those of bacterial and viral meningitis. Upon abrupt disease onset, a plethora of problems arise. Endogenous cytokines, which release in response to pathogens, affect the hypothalamus’ thermoregulatory neurons and cause a rise in body temperature.[16] Additionally, cytokines may act on the vascular organ of the lamina terminalis, leading to the synthesis of prostaglandin (PG) E2 which acts on the hypothalamus, resulting in an increase in body temperature.[17] Also, the release of cytokines and exogenous exotoxins coupled with an increase in intracranial pressure stimulate nociceptors in the meninges[16] creating pain sensations.The release of cytotoxic molecules in the central nervous system results in extensive tissue damage and necrosis, such as damage to the olfactory nerve through lysis of nerve cells and demyelination.[18] Specifically, the olfactory nerve and bulbs become necrotic and hemorrhagic.[19] Spinal flexion leads to nuchal rigidity, or stiff neck, due to the stretching of the inflamed meninges.[16] The increase in intracranial pressure stimulates the area postrema to create nausea sensations which may lead to brain herniation and damage to the reticular formation.[16] Ultimately, the increase in cerebrospinal fluid from inflammation of the meninges increases intracranial pressure and leads to the destruction of the central nervous system. Although the exact pathophysiology behind the seizures caused by PAM is unknown, scientists speculate that the seizures arise from altered meningeal permeability[16] caused by increased intracranial pressure.Pathogenesis[edit]Roman Baths in Bath, Somerset, closed for bathing since 1978 due to presence of N. fowleriNaegleria fowleri propagates in warm, stagnant bodies of freshwater (typically during the summer months), and enters the central nervous system after insufflation of infected water by attaching itself to the olfactory nerve.[2] It then migrates through the cribriform plate and into the olfactory bulbs of the forebrain,[20] where it multiplies itself greatly by feeding on nerve tissue.Diagnosis[edit]N. fowleri can be grown in several kinds of liquid axenic media or on non-nutrient agar plates coated with bacteria. Escherichia coli can be used to overlay the non-nutrient agar plate and a drop of cerebrospinal fluid sediment is added to it. Plates are then incubated at 37°C and checked daily for clearing of the agar in thin tracks, which indicate the trophozoites have fed on the bacteria.[21]Detection in water is performed by centrifuging a water sample with E. coli added, then applying the pellet to a non-nutrient agar plate. After several days, the plate is microscopically inspected and Naegleria cysts are identified by their morphology. Final confirmation of the species\\' identity can be performed by various molecular or biochemical methods.[22]Confirmation of Naegleria presence can be done by a so-called flagellation test, where the organism is exposed to a hypotonic environment (distilled water). Naegleria, in contrast to other amoebae, differentiates within two hours into the flagellate state. Pathogenicity can be further confirmed by exposure to high temperature (42°C): Naegleria fowleri is able to grow at this temperature, but the nonpathogenic Naegleria gruberi is not.[citation needed]Prevention[edit]Michael Beach, a recreational waterborne illness specialist for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, stated in remarks to the Associated Press that wearing of nose-clips to prevent insufflation of contaminated water would be effective protection against contracting PAM, noting that \"You\\'d have to have water going way up in your nose to begin with\".[23]Advice stated in the press release from Taiwan\\'s Centers for Disease Control recommended people prevent fresh water from entering the nostrils and avoid putting their heads down into fresh water or stirring mud in the water with feet. When starting to suffer from fever, headache, nausea, or vomiting subsequent to any kind of exposure to fresh water, even in the belief that no fresh water has traveled through the nostrils, people with such conditions should be carried to hospital quickly and make sure doctors are well-informed about the history of exposure to fresh water.[24]Treatment[edit]On the basis of the laboratory evidence and case reports, heroic doses[25] of amphotericin B have been the traditional mainstay of PAM treatment since the first reported survivor in the United States in 1982.[4]Treatment has often also used combination therapy with multiple other antimicrobials in addition to amphotericin, such as fluconazole, miconazole, rifampicin and azithromycin. They have shown limited success only when administered early in the course of an infection.[26] Fluconazole is commonly used as it has been shown to have synergistic effects against naegleria when used with amphotericin in-vitro.[4]While the use of rifampicin has been common, including in all four North American cases of survival, its continued use has been questioned.[4] It only has variable activity in-vitro and it has strong effects on the therapeutic levels of other antimicrobials used by inducing cytochrome p450 pathways.[4]In 2013, two successfully treated cases in the United States utilized the medication miltefosine.[3] As of 2015, there was no data on how well miltefosine is able to reach the central nervous system.[4] As of 2015 the U.S. CDC offered miltefosine to doctors for the treatment of free-living ameobas including naegleria.[3] In one of the cases, a 12-year-old female, was given miltefosine and targeted temperature management to manage cerebral edema that is secondary to the infection. She survived with no neurological damage. The targeted temperature management commingled with early diagnosis and the miltefosine medication has been attributed with her survival. On the other hand, the other survivor, an 8-year-old male, was diagnosed several days after symptoms appeared and was not treated with targeted temperature management; however, he was administered the miltefosine. He suffered what is likely permanent neurological damage.[3]In 2016, a 16-year-old boy also survived PAM. He was treated with the same protocols of the 12-year-old girl in 2013. He recovered making a near complete neurological recovery; however, he has stated that learning has been more difficult for him since contracting the disease.[3][27]In 2018, a 10-year-old girl in the Spanish city of Toledo became the first person to have PAM in Spain, and was successfully treated using intravenous and intrathecal amphotericin B.[28]Prognosis[edit]This section needs to be updated. Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.(November 2019)Since its first description in the 1960s, only seven people worldwide had been reported to have survived PAM by 2015, out of 450 cases diagnosed, implying a fatality rate of about 98.5%.[2] The survivors include four in the United States, one in Mexico and one in Spain. One of the US survivors had brain damage that is probably permanent, but there are two documented surviving cases in the United States who made a full recovery with no neurological damage; they were both treated with the same protocols.[3][4]Epidemiology[edit]The disease is rare and highly lethal: there had only been 300 cases as of 2008.[29] Drug treatment research at Aga Khan University in Pakistan has shown that in-vitro drug susceptibility tests with some FDA approved drugs used for non-infectious diseases (digoxin and procyclidine were shown to be most effective of the drugs studied) have proved to kill Naegleria fowleri with an amoebicidal rate greater than 95%.[30] The same source has also proposed a device for drug delivery via the transcranial route to the brain.[31]In the US, the most common states with cases reported of PAM from N. fowleri are the southern states, with Texas and Florida having the highest prevalence. The most commonly affected age group is 5–14 year olds (those who play in water).[32] The number of cases of infection could increase due to climate change, and was posited as the reason for three cases in Minnesota in 2010, 2012, and 2015.[33][34]As of 2013, the numbers of reported cases were expected to increase simply because of better-informed diagnoses being made both in ongoing cases and in autopsy findings.[35]History[edit]This form of nervous system infection by amoeba was first documented in Australia in 1965.[36][37] In 1966, four cases were reported in the US. By 1968 the causative organism, previously thought to be a species of Acanthamoeba or Hartmannella, was identified as Naegleria. This same year, occurrence of sixteen cases over a period of three years (1962–1965) was reported in Ústí nad Labem, Czechoslovakia.[38] In 1970, the species of amoeba was named N. fowleri.[39]Australian physicians Fowler and Carter first described human disease caused by amebo-flagellates in Adelaide in 1965.[40][41] Their work on amebo-flagellates has provided an example of how a protozoan can effectively live both freely in the environment, and in a human host. Since 1965, more than 144 cases have been confirmed in different countries. In 1966, Fowler termed the infection resulting from N. fowleri primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) to distinguish this central nervous system (CNS) invasion from other secondary invasions made by other amoebae such as Entamoeba histolytica.[40] A retrospective study determined the first documented case of PAM possibly occurred in Britain in 1909.[42]The species Naegleria fowleri was named for Mathieu Naegler (1867–1934), a French parasitologist and zoologist who discovered it for the first time in 1899, and Malcolm Fowler (1924–1974), the Australian doctor who described the distinct disease process of the pathogen in Australia in 1965.[citation needed]Society and culture[edit]Naegleria fowleri is also known as the \"brain-eating amoeba\". The term has also been applied to Balamuthia mandrillaris, causing some confusion between the two; Balamuthia mandrillaris is unrelated to Naegleria fowleri, and causes a different disease called granulomatous amoebic encephalitis. Unlike naegleriasis, which is usually seen in people with normal immune function, granulomatous amoebic encephalitis is usually seen in people with poor immune function, such as those with HIV/AIDS or leukemia.[43]Naegleriasis was the topic of Episodes 20–21, Season 2 in the medical mystery drama House, M.D.[44][45]Research[edit]The U.S. National Institutes of Health budgeted $800,000 for research on the disease in 2016.[46] Phenothiazines have been tested in vitro and in animal models of PAM.[47] Improving case detection through increased awareness, reporting, and information about cases might enable earlier detection of infections, provide insight into the human or environmental determinants of infection, and allow improved assessment of treatment effectiveness.[2]See also[edit]Balamuthia mandrillaris – unrelated pathogenic organism that shares the same common name as N. fowleriReferences[edit]^ .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}Fortin, Jacey (25 July 2019). \"Man Dies of \\'Brain-Eating\\' Amoeba After Swimming in Lake\".

       "   'text': 'Erythema toxicum neonatorumOther namesErythema toxicum,[1] Urticaria neonatorum and Toxic erythema of the newborn[1]SpecialtyPediatricsErythema toxicum neonatorum is a common, non-threatening rash in newborns.[1][2] It appears in 4-70% of newborns within the first week of life, and it typically improves within 1-2 weeks.[2][3][4] It only occurs during the newborn period, but may appear slightly later in premature babies.[2][3] The rash has a variable appearance. It typically includes blotchy red spots, often with overlying firm, yellow-white bumps or pus-filled boils.[3][5] There may be only a few or many lesions. The lesions can appear almost anywhere on the body, and individual lesions may appear and disappear within hours.[3] There are no other symptoms associated with erythema toxicum neonatorum, and the rash does not have any long-term effects on the skin. Erythema toxicum neonatorum is not harmful and does not require any treatment.[3][5]Contents1 Epidemiology2 Presentation3 Cause4 Diagnosis5 Treatment6 History7 References8 External linksEpidemiology[edit]The exact prevalence of erythema toxicum neonatorum is unknown, and studies estimate prevalence as low as 3.7 percent to as high as 72 percent.[6] It is one of the most commonly diagnosed rashes in healthy babies.[7][6] It is more common among infants born at higher gestational age and is rare among premature infants. Erythema toxicum neonatorum is more likely to develop in infants delivered vaginally.[4] Higher birth weight is an additional risk factor. There may be a slightly increased risk in males, but this association is unclear. There are no known associations with race or ethnicity.[6]Presentation[edit]Erythema toxicum neonatorum usually appears during the first week of life, most often on day two.[3][8] It may develop several days or weeks later in premature babies.[3]The rash has a variable appearance, ranging from a few blotchy red spots to many yellow-white bumps and boils. The classic presentation is 1-3 mm, firm, yellow-white bumps with a surrounding red halo. The rash is often described as \"flea-bitten.\" There may be only a few or many lesions, and they may be clustered or widespread. The rash often appears on the cheeks first and may later spread throughout the face, trunk, arms, and legs.[3][5] Lesions most often appear on the thighs, buttocks, and trunk. The palms and soles are not affected, likely because the skin in these areas does not have hair follicles.[4]Individual lesions may grow and shrink over hours or days. They usually fade within a week or two.[5] The rash may recur within the next few weeks, but this is rare.[3][5]Cause[edit]Erythema toxicum neonatorum is related to activation of the immune system, but its exact cause is unknown. Many inflammatory factors have been detected in erythema toxicum neonatorum lesions, including IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-8, and eotaxin.[3][4] These molecules cause redness and swelling in the skin and attract immune cells.[9]Eosinophils and other immune cells are found in the upper layer of the skin in erythema toxicum neonatorum lesions.[3][8] Immune cells tend to cluster around hair follicles in particular. The leading hypothesis about the cause of erythema toxicum neonatorum is that bacteria activate the immune system when they enter hair follicles for the first time.[4][8] This is part of a normal process in which bacteria from the environment start to grow on a baby\\'s skin. It is unknown whether the immune response that causes erythema toxicum neonatorum is helpful to the baby.[4]Diagnosis[edit]Health professionals can diagnose erythema toxicum neonatorum with a skin exam. Most cases of erythema toxicum neonatorum can be diagnosed without further testing. If more testing is needed to make a diagnosis, the contents of a lesion can be examined under a microscope. A health professional may make a small cut into a pus-filled lesion and collect a swab of pus for testing. Lesions caused by erythema toxicum neonatorum contain eosinophils and other immune cells. These cells can be seen under a microscope when a special stain is applied to the sample.[5]Since the appearance of erythema toxicum neonatorum varies, it may be confused with other newborn rashes. Some newborn infections cause bumps or boils, which may look like erythema toxicum neonatorum.[5] Bacterial infections, including Staphylococcus and Streptococcus infections, almost always cause additional symptoms. These symptoms may be severe, and they are usually not limited to rash. Bacterial rashes can be diagnosed by testing pus from a lesion along with a blood sample. Bacteria can be seen under a microscope with a special stain or may be found on a culture. Fungal infection with Candida may also cause a similar rash in newborns, but it usually causes additional symptoms like thrush. Similarly, fungus can be seen under a microscope or found on a culture. Some viral infections may cause a rash with boils on a reddish base. Rashes caused by herpes simplex virus and varicella zoster virus in particular may be confused with erythema toxicum neonatorum. These viruses are diagnosed by scraping the base of a lesion. Multinucleated giant cells can be seen under a microscope. Some of these tests may be ordered if the diagnosis is unclear.[5]Treatment[edit]Erythema toxicum neonatorum resolves without treatment, typically within one or two weeks.[3] There are no associated systemic symptoms or long-term consequences of the rash.[3][7]History[edit]The rash of erythema toxicum neonatorum has been described by doctors for centuries. Ancient Mesopotamians believed that it represented a cleansing mechanism against the mother\\'s blood. Later physicians believed that it was caused by the skin\\'s response to meconium.[6] The name erythema toxicum neonatorum was first used by Dr. Karl Leiner in 1912 because he believed that the rash was caused by enterotoxins. Although Leiner\\'s hypothesis was incorrect and the rash is not actually caused by toxins, the medical community continues to call the rash erythema toxicum neonatorum.[3][6]References[edit]^ a b c .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}Rapini, Ronald P.; Bolognia, Jean L.; Jorizzo, Joseph L.

       "   'text': 'A number sign (#) is used with this entry because of evidence that susceptibility to fulminant viral hepatitis (FVH) is conferred by homozygous mutation in the IL18BP gene (604113) on chromosome 11q13. One such patient has been reported.Clinical FeaturesBelkaya et al. (2019) reported an 11-year-old girl, born of consanguineous Algerian parents, who developed fatal fulminant hepatitis upon acute infection with hepatitis A. The patient presented with fatigue, nausea, hepatomegaly, jaundice, decreased appetite, incoherent speech, and gingival bleeding, which rapidly progressed to coma, icterus, and liver failure. Liver enzymes were significantly increased, and she underwent liver transplantation, but died a day later of multiorgan failure. She had no previous chronic or acute liver disease, and her 2 brothers experienced benign hepatitis A infections. However, she had a history of autoimmune disease, including insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus with anti-islet cell and anti-insulin antibodies, Hashimoto thyroiditis with antithyroperoxidase antibodies, and antithyroglobulin antibodies. She was also seropositive for CMV and EBV. She had no other features of an immunodeficiency.InheritanceThe transmission pattern of FVH in the family reported by Belkaya et al. (2019) was consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance.Molecular GeneticsIn an 11-year-old girl, born of consanguineous Algerian parents, with FVH, Belkaya et al. (2019) identified a homozygous 40-bp deletion in the IL18BP gene (604113.0001), resulting in splicing abnormalities and complete IL18BP deficiency. The mutation, which was found by whole-exome sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing, segregated with the disorder in the family. In vitro functional expression studies showed that the abnormal transcripts resulting from the mutation were unable to block any IL18 activity compared to wildtype or missense variants. Patient liver tissue showed high IL18 levels, barely detectable IL18BP, and high levels of inflammatory cells. Additional in vitro cellular studies showed that in the wildtype state, IL18-activated NK cells killed both infected and uninfected hepatocytes, and that this cytotoxicity was reversed by the addition of IL18BP. The findings indicated that absence of IL18BP in the patient with fulminant viral hepatitis due to hepatitis A led to uncontrolled IL18-mediated cytotoxic activity and an activated host response against hepatocytes.'},\n",

       "   'title': 'Alternating hemiplegia of childhood',\n",
       "   'text': 'Alternating hemiplegia of childhood is a neurological condition characterized by recurrent episodes of temporary paralysis, often affecting one side of the body (hemiplegia). During some episodes, the paralysis alternates from one side of the body to the other or affects both sides at the same time. These episodes begin in infancy or early childhood, usually before 18 months of age, and the paralysis lasts from minutes to days.In addition to paralysis, affected individuals can have sudden attacks of uncontrollable muscle activity; these can cause involuntary limb movements (choreoathetosis), muscle tensing (dystonia), movement of the eyes (nystagmus), or shortness of breath (dyspnea). People with alternating hemiplegia of childhood may also experience sudden redness and warmth (flushing) or unusual paleness (pallor) of the skin. These attacks can occur during or separately from episodes of hemiplegia.The episodes of hemiplegia or uncontrolled movements can be triggered by certain factors, such as stress, extreme tiredness, cold temperatures, or bathing, although the trigger is not always known. A characteristic feature of alternating hemiplegia of childhood is that all symptoms disappear while the affected person is sleeping but can reappear shortly after awakening. The number and length of the episodes initially worsen throughout childhood but then begin to decrease over time. The uncontrollable muscle movements may disappear entirely, but the episodes of hemiplegia occur throughout life.Alternating hemiplegia of childhood also causes mild to severe cognitive problems. Almost all affected individuals have some level of developmental delay and intellectual disability. Their cognitive functioning typically declines over time.FrequencyAlternating hemiplegia of childhood is a rare condition that affects approximately 1 in 1 million people.CausesAlternating hemiplegia of childhood is primarily caused by mutations in the ATP1A3 gene. Very rarely, a mutation in the ATP1A2 gene is involved in the condition. These genes provide instructions for making very similar proteins. They function as different forms of one piece, the alpha subunit, of a larger protein complex called Na+/K+ ATPase; the two versions of the complex are found in different parts of the brain. Both versions play a critical role in the normal function of nerve cells (neurons). Na+/K+ ATPase transports charged atoms (ions) into and out of neurons, which is an essential part of the signaling process that controls muscle movement.Mutations in the ATP1A3 or ATP1A2 gene reduce the activity of the Na+/K+ ATPase, impairing its ability to transport ions normally. It is unclear how a malfunctioning Na+/K+ ATPase causes the episodes of paralysis or uncontrollable movements characteristic of alternating hemiplegia of childhood.Learn more about the genes associated with Alternating hemiplegia of childhoodATP1A2ATP1A3Inheritance PatternAlternating hemiplegia of childhood is considered an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases of alternating hemiplegia of childhood result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. However, the condition can also run in families. For unknown reasons, the signs and symptoms are typically milder when the condition is found in multiple family members than when a single individual is affected.'},\n",

This syndrome leads to developmental regressionandcausesa specific pattern,known ashypsarrhythmia (chaotic brain waves), on electroencephalography (EEG) testing. The infantile spasms usually begin in the first year of life, typically between 4-8 months. The seizures primarily consist of a sudden bending forward of the body with stiffening of the arms and legs; some children arch their backs as they extend their arms and legs. Spasms tend to occur upon awakening or after feeding, and often occur in clusters of up to 100 spasms at a time. Infants may have dozens of clusters and several hundred spasms per day. Infantile spasms usually stop by age five, but may be replaced by other types of seizures. Manydisorders leading to brain injury, such as birth problems, cerebral anomalies,metabolic disorders, and genetic disorders can lead to these spasms, making it important to identify the underlying cause.In some children, no cause can be found.

       "   'text': 'Neonatal Bowel obstructionOther namesNeonatal intestinal obstructionSpecialtyNeonatologyNeonatal bowel obstruction (NBO) or neonatal intestinal obstruction is the most common surgical emergency in the neonatal period.[1] It may occur due to a variety of conditions and has an excellent outcome based on timely diagnosis and appropriate intervention.[2]Contents1 Presentation2 Cause3 Diagnosis4 Treatment5 Prognosis6 Epidemiology7 See also8 References9 Further reading10 External linksPresentation[edit]The neonatal bowel obstruction is suspected based on polyhydramnios in utero, bilious vomiting, failure to pass meconium in the first day of life, and abdominal distension.[3] The presentations of NBO may vary.[4] It may be subtle and easily overlooked on physical examination or can involve massive abdominal distension, respiratory distress and cardiovascular collapse.[4] Unlike older children, neonates with unrecognized intestinal obstruction deteriorate rapidly.[5]Cause[edit]Causes of bowel obstruction in neonates include:[citation needed]Hirschprung\\'s diseaseMeconium ileusMeconium plug syndromeIntussusceptionsDuodenal/ileal/colonic atresiaNeonatal small left colon syndromeDiagnosis[edit]Neonatal bowel obstruction is grouped into two general categories: high, or proximal, obstruction and low, or distal obstruction, both of which are suspected by failure to pass meconium at birth. High obstruction can be suspected based on the double bubble sign. Cases without distal gas are usually related to duodenal atresia, while high obstruction with distal gas need an upper gastrointestinal series because of the need to distinguish duodenal web, duodenal stenosis and annular pancreas from midgut volvulus, the latter being a surgical emergency. Confirmation is ultimately by surgical intervention.[6]A low obstruction is suspected on plain film, but needs follow up with a gastrografin enema, which itself can be therapeutic. The differential for low obstruction is ileal atresia, meconium ileus, meconium plug syndrome and Hirschsprung disease. In cases of meconium ileus or ileal atresia, the colon distal to the obstruction is hypoplastic, usually less than 1cm in caliber, as development of normal colonic caliber in utero is due to the passage of meconium, which does not occur in either of these conditions. When diffusely small caliber is seen, it is referred to as microcolon. Radiographs in meconium ileus classically demonstrate a bubbly appearance in the right lower quadrant due to a combination of ingested air and meconium. If, on contrast enema, reflux into the dilated distal small bowel loops can be achieved, the study is both diagnostic and therapeutic, as the ionic contrast medium can dissolve the meconium to allow passage of enteric content into the unused colon.[6]If contrast cannot be refluxed into the distal small bowel, ileal atresia remains a diagnostic possibility.[6]Treatment[edit]Jejunal and ileal atresia are caused by in utero vascular insults, leading to poor recanalization of distal small bowel segments, a condition in which surgical resection and reanastamosis are mandatory. Hirschsprung disease is due to an arrest in neural cell ganglia, leading to absent innervation of a segment distal bowel, and appears as a massively dilated segment of distal bowel on contrast enema. Surgical resection is necessary for this condition as well. Imperforate anus also requires surgical management, with the diagnosis made by inability to pass the rectal tube through the anal sphincter.[6] Supportive intravenous hydration, gastric decompression, and ventilatory support may be needed due to poor neonatal nutrition resulting from dysfunctional bowel absorption.[4]Prognosis[edit]With early intervention, morbidity and mortality of cases of intestinal obstruction is low. The outcome is in part dependent upon congenital comorbidities and delays in diagnosis and management.[7]Epidemiology[edit]It has an estimated incidence of about 1 in 2000 live births.[4]See also[edit]Bowel obstructionReferences[edit]^ .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}Vinocur, Daniel N.; Lee, Edward Y.; Eisenberg, Ronald L.

The illness affects a single cerebral hemisphere and generally occurs in children under the age of 15.Contents1 Signs and symptoms2 Pathophysiology3 Diagnosis4 Treatment5 History6 Society7 References8 External linksSigns and symptoms[edit]The condition mostly affects children, with an average age of 6 years. However, one in ten people with the condition develops it in adulthood.[citation needed]There are two main stages, sometimes preceded by a \\'prodromal stage\\' of a few months. In the acute stage, lasting four to eight months, the inflammation is active and the symptoms become progressively worse. These include weakness of one side of the body (hemiparesis), loss of vision for one side of the visual field (hemianopia), and cognitive difficulties (affecting learning, memory or language, for example). Epileptic seizures are also a major part of the illness, although these are often partial. Focal motor seizures or epilepsia partialis continua are particularly common, and may be very difficult to control with drugs.[citation needed]In the chronic or residual stage, the inflammation is no longer active, but the sufferer is left with some or all of the symptoms because of the damage that the inflammation has caused. In the long term, most patients are left with some epilepsy, paralysis and cognitive problems, but the severity varies considerably.[1]Pathophysiology[edit]In Rasmussen\\'s encephalitis, there is chronic inflammation of the brain, with infiltration of T lymphocytes into the brain tissue. In most cases, this affects only one cerebral hemisphere, either the left or the right. This inflammation causes permanent damage to the cells of the brain, leading to atrophy of the hemisphere; the epilepsy that this causes may itself contribute to the brain damage. The epilepsy might derive from a disturbed GABA release,[2] the main inhibitory neurotransmitter of the mammalian brain.The cause of the inflammation is not known: infection by a virus has been suggested, but the evidence for this is inconclusive.[1] In the 1990s it was suggested that auto-antibodies against the glutamate receptor GluR3 were important in causing the disease,[3] but this is no longer thought to be the case.[4] However, more recent studies report the presence of autoantibodies against the NMDA-type glutamate receptor subunit GluRepsilon2 (anti-NR2A antibodies) in a subset of patients with Rasmussen\\'s encephalitis.[5] There has also been some evidence that patients suffering from RE express auto-antibodies against alpha 7 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.[6] By sequencing T cell receptors from various compartments it could be shown that RE patients present with peripheral CD8+ T-cell expansion which in some cases have been proven for years after disease onset.[7]Rasmussen\\'s encephalitis has been recorded with a neurovisceral porphyria, and acute intermittent porphyria.[8]Diagnosis[edit]Brain biopsy in Rasmussen\\'s encephalitis showing lymphocytic infiltrates staining for CD8 on immunohistochemistryBrain MRI of an 8-year-old female with Rasmussen\\'s encephalitis.Left: December 2008, the patient was presented with headache and epilepsia partialis continua. There are lesions with local brain swelling in the right parietal and occipital lobes and right cerebellar hemisphere.Right: April 2009, the same patient, now she is comatose with epilepsia partialis continua. There is progression of the encephalitis - the left cerebral hemisphere has been involved with severe brain swelling and shift of the midline structures.The diagnosis may be made on the clinical features alone, along with tests to rule out other possible causes. An EEG will usually show the electrical features of epilepsy and slowing of brain activity in the affected hemisphere, and MRI brain scans will show gradual shrinkage of the affected hemisphere with signs of inflammation or scarring.[9]Brain biopsy can provide very strong confirmation of the diagnosis, but this is not always necessary.[9][10]Treatment[edit]During the acute stage, treatment is aimed at reducing the inflammation. As in other inflammatory diseases, steroids may be used first of all, either as a short course of high-dose treatment, or in a lower dose for long-term treatment. Intravenous immunoglobulin is also effective both in the short term and in the long term, particularly in adults where it has been proposed as first-line treatment.[11] Other similar treatments include plasmapheresis and tacrolimus, though there is less evidence for these. None of these treatments can prevent permanent disability from developing.[9][12]During the residual stage of the illness when there is no longer active inflammation, treatment is aimed at improving the remaining symptoms. Standard anti-epileptic drugs are usually ineffective in controlling seizures, and it may be necessary to surgically remove or disconnect the affected cerebral hemisphere, in an operation called hemispherectomy or via a corpus callosotomy. This usually results in further weakness, hemianopsia and cognitive problems, but the other side of the brain may be able to take over some of the function, particularly in young children. The operation may not be advisable if the left hemisphere is affected, since this hemisphere contains most of the parts of the brain that control language. However, hemispherectomy is often very effective in reducing seizures.[1][9]History[edit]It is named for the neurosurgeon Theodore Rasmussen[de] (1910–2002), who succeeded Wilder Penfield as head of the Montreal Neurological Institute, and served as Neurosurgeon-in-Chief at the Royal Victoria Hospital.[13][14]Society[edit]The Hemispherectomy Foundation was formed in 2008 to assist families with children who have Rasmussen\\'s encephalitis and other conditions that require hemispherectomy.[15]The RE Children\\'s Project was founded in 2010 to increase awareness of Rasmussen\\'s encephalitis.Its primary purpose is to support scientific research directed toward finding a cure for this disease.[citation needed]References[edit]^ a b c .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}Bien, CG;etal.

If the complication of multi-organ failure ensues, signs and symptoms of those failing organs will appear, such as abdominal pain, jaundice, shortness of breath, and diminished urine output.Onset[edit]The seizures of eclampsia typically present during pregnancy and prior to delivery (the antepartum period),[19] but may also occur during labor and delivery (the intrapartum period) or after the baby has been delivered (the postpartum period).[15][18][20] If postpartum seizures develop, it is most likely to occur within the first 48 hours after delivery. However, late postpartum seizures of eclampsia may occur as late as 4 weeks after delivery.[15][18]Complications[edit]There are risks to both the mother and the fetus when eclampsia occurs. The fetus may grow more slowly than normal within the womb (uterus) of a woman with eclampsia, which is termed intrauterine growth restriction and may result in the child appearing small for gestational age or being born with low birth weight.[21] Eclampsia may cause problems with the placenta to occur. The placenta may bleed (hemorrhage) or it may begin to separate from the wall of the uterus.[22][23] It is normal for the placenta to separate from the uterine wall during delivery, but it is abnormal for it to separate prior to delivery; this condition is called placental abruption and can be dangerous for the fetus.[24] Placental insufficiency may also occur, a state in which the placenta fails to support appropriate fetal development because it cannot deliver the necessary amount of oxygen or nutrients to the fetus.[22] During an eclamptic seizure, the beating of the fetal heart may become slower than normal (bradycardia).[21][25] If any of these complications occurs, fetal distress may develop. Treatment of the mother\\'s seizures may also manage fetal bradycardia.[26][27] If the risk to the health of the fetus or the mother is high, the definitive treatment for eclampsia is delivery of the baby. Delivery by cesarean section may be deemed necessary, especially if the instance of fetal bradycardia does not resolve after 10 to 15 minutes of resuscitative interventions.[26][28] It may be safer to deliver the infant preterm than to wait for the full 40 weeks of fetal development to finish, and as a result prematurity is also a potential complication of eclampsia.[22][29]In the mother, changes in vision may occur as a result of eclampsia, and these changes may include blurry vision, one-sided blindness (either temporary due to amaurosis fugax or potentially permanent due to retinal detachment), or cortical blindness, which affects the vision from both eyes.[30][31] There are also potential complications in the lungs. The woman may have fluid slowly collecting in the lungs in a process known as pulmonary edema.[22] During an eclamptic seizure, it is possible for a person to vomit the contents of the stomach and to inhale some of this material in a process known as aspiration.[21] If aspiration occurs, the woman may experience difficulty breathing immediately or could develop an infection in the lungs later, called aspiration pneumonia.[18][32] It is also possible that during a seizure breathing will stop temporarily or become inefficient, and the amount of oxygen reaching the woman\\'s body and brain will be decreased (in a state known as hypoxia).[18][33] If it becomes difficult for the woman to breathe, she may need to have her breathing temporarily supported by an assistive device in a process called mechanical ventilation. In some severe eclampsia cases, the mother may become weak and sluggish (lethargy) or even comatose.[31] These may be signs that the brain is swelling (cerebral edema) or bleeding (intracerebral hemorrhage).[22][31]Risk factors[edit]Eclampsia, like pre-eclampsia, tends to occur more commonly in first pregnancies.[34][35][36] Women who have long term high blood pressure before becoming pregnant have a greater risk of pre-eclampsia.[34][35] Furthermore, women with other pre-existing vascular diseases (diabetes or nephropathy) or thrombophilic diseases such as the antiphospholipid syndrome are at higher risk to develop pre-eclampsia and eclampsia.[34][35] Having a large placenta (multiple gestation, hydatidiform mole) also predisposes women to eclampsia.[34][35][37] In addition, there is a genetic component: a woman whose mother or sister had the condition is at higher risk than otherwise.[38] Women who have experienced eclampsia are at increased risk for pre-eclampsia/eclampsia in a later pregnancy.[35] People of certain ethnic backgrounds can have an increased risk of developing pre-eclampsia and eclampsia. The occurrence of pre-eclampsia was 5% in white, 9% in Hispanic, and 11% in African American women. Black women were also shown to have a disproportionately higher risk of dying from eclampsia.[39]Mechanism[edit]Diagram of the placenta and its position in the uterus during pregnancyImage of a placenta after deliveryThe presence of a placenta is required, and eclampsia resolves if it is removed.[40] Reduced blood flow to the placenta (placental hypoperfusion) is a key feature of the process. It is accompanied by increased sensitivity of the maternal vasculature to agents which cause constriction of the small arteries, leading to reduced blood flow to multiple organs. Vascular dysfunction-associated maternal conditions such as Lupus, hypertension, and renal disease, or obstetric conditions that increase placental volume without an increase in placental blood flow (such as twin pregnancy) can increase risk for pre-eclampsia.[41] Also, an activation of the coagulation cascade may lead to microthrombi formation, which can further impair blood flow. Thirdly, increased vascular permeability results in the shift of extracellular fluid from the blood to the interstitial space, with further reduction in blood flow, and edema. These events lead to hypertension; renal, pulmonary, and hepatic dysfunction; and cerebral edema with cerebral dysfunction and convulsions.[40] Before symptoms appear, increased platelet and endothelial activation may be detected.[40]Placental hypoperfusion is linked to abnormal modelling of the fetal–maternal placental interface that may be immunologically mediated.[40] Pre-eclampsia’s pathogenesis is poorly understood, but it likely is attributed to factors related to the mother and placenta, because pre-eclampsia is seen in molar pregnancies absent of a fetus or fetal tissue.[41]The placenta produces the potent vasodilator adrenomedullin: it is reduced in pre-eclampsia and eclampsia.[42] Other vasodilators are also reduced, including prostacyclin, thromboxane A2, nitric oxide, and endothelins, also leading to vasoconstriction.[25]Eclampsia is a form of hypertensive encephalopathy: cerebral vascular resistance is reduced, leading to increased blood flow to the brain, cerebral edema and resultant convulsions.[43] An eclamptic convulsion usually does not cause chronic brain damage unless intracranial haemorrhage occurs.[44]Diagnosis[edit]If a pregnant woman has already been diagnosed with pre-eclampsia during the current pregnancy and then develops a seizure, she may be assigned a \\'clinical diagnosis\\' of eclampsia without further workup. While seizures are most common in the third trimester, they may occur any time from 20 weeks of pregnancy until 6 weeks after birth.[45] A diagnosis of eclampsia is most likely given the symptoms and medical history, and eclampsia can be assumed to be the correct diagnosis until proven otherwise.[46] However, if a woman has a seizure and it is unknown whether or not she has pre-eclampsia, testing can help make the diagnosis clear.Vital signs[edit]One of the core features of pre-eclampsia is high blood pressure. Blood pressure is a measurement of two numbers. If either the top number (systolic blood pressure) is greater than 140 mmHg or the bottom number (diastolic blood pressure) is greater than 90 mmHg, then the blood pressure is higher than the normal range and the person has high blood pressure. If the systolic blood pressure is greater than 160 or the diastolic pressure is greater than 110, the hypertension is considered to be severe.[15]Laboratory testing[edit]Another core feature of pre-eclampsia is proteinuria, which is the presence of excess protein in the urine. To determine if proteinuria is present, the urine can be collected and tested for protein; if there is 0.3 grams of protein or more in the urine of a pregnant woman collected over 24 hours, this is one of the diagnostic criteria for pre-eclampsia and raises the suspicion that a seizure is due to eclampsia.[15]In cases of severe eclampsia or pre-eclampsia, the level of platelets in the blood can be low in a condition termed thrombocytopenia.[47][25] A complete blood count, or CBC, is a test of the blood that can be performed to check platelet levels.Other investigations include: kidney function test, liver function tests (LFT), coagulation screen, 24-hour urine creatinine, and fetal/placental ultrasound.Differential diagnosis[edit]Convulsions during pregnancy that are unrelated to pre-eclampsia need to be distinguished from eclampsia. Such disorders include seizure disorders as well as brain tumor, aneurysm of the brain, and medication- or drug-related seizures. Usually, the presence of the signs of severe pre-eclampsia precede and accompany eclampsia, facilitating the diagnosis.[medical citation needed]Prevention[edit]Detection and management of pre-eclampsia is critical to reduce the risk of eclampsia. The USPSTF recommends regular checking of blood pressure through pregnancy in order to detect preeclampsia.[48] Appropriate management of women with pre-eclampsia generally involves the use of magnesium sulfate to prevent eclamptic seizures.[49] In some cases, low-dose aspirin has been shown to decrease the risk of pre-eclampsia in pregnant women, especially when taken in the late first trimester.[16]Treatment[edit]The four goals of the treatment of eclampsia are to stop and prevent further convulsions, to control the elevated blood pressure, to deliver the baby as promptly as possible, and to monitor closely for the onset of multi-organ failure.Convulsions[edit]Convulsions are prevented and treated using magnesium sulfate.[50] The study demonstrating the effectiveness of magnesium sulfate for the management of eclampsia was first published in 1955.[51]Effective anticonvulsant serum levels range from 2.5 to 7.5 mEq/liter. [52]With intravenous administration, the onset of anticonvulsant action is fast and lasts about 30 minutes. Following intramuscular administration the onset of action is about one hour and lasts for three to four hours. Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidneys at a rate proportional to the plasma concentration and glomerular filtration. [52] Magnesium sulfate is associated with several minor side effects; serious side effects are uncommon, occurring at elevated magnesium serum concentrations > 7.0 mEQ/L. Serious toxicity can be counteracted with calcium gluconate. [53]Even with therapeutic serum magnesium concentrations, recurrent convulsions may occur, and additional magnesium may be needed, but with close monitoring for respiratory, cardiac, and neurological depression. If magnesium administration with resultant high serum concentrations fail to control convulsions, the addition of other intravenous anticonvulsants may be used, facilitate intubation and mechanical ventilation, and to avoid magnesium toxicity including maternal thoracic muscle paralysis.Magnesium sulfate results in better outcomes than diazepam, phenytoin or a combination of chlorpromazine, promethazine, and pethidine.[54][55][56]Blood pressure management[edit]Blood pressure control is used to prevent stroke, which accounts for 15 to 20 percent of deaths in women with eclampsia.[57] The agents of choice for blood pressure control during eclampsia are hydralazine or labetalol.[25] This is because of their effectiveness, lack of negative effects on the fetus, and mechanism of action. Blood pressure management is indicated with a diastolic blood pressure above 105–110mm Hg.[28]Delivery[edit]If the baby has not yet been delivered, steps need to be taken to stabilize the woman and deliver her speedily. This needs to be done even if the baby is immature, as the eclamptic condition is unsafe for both baby and mother. As eclampsia is a manifestation of a type of non-infectious multiorgan dysfunction or failure, other organs (liver, kidney, lungs, cardiovascular system, and coagulation system) need to be assessed in preparation for a delivery (often a caesarean section), unless the woman is already in advanced labor. Regional anesthesia for caesarean section is contraindicated when a coagulopathy has developed.There is limited to no evidence in favor of a particular delivery method for women with eclampsia. Therefore, the delivery method of choice is an individualized decision.[27]Monitoring[edit]Invasive hemodynamic monitoring may be elected in an eclamptic woman at risk for or with heart disease, kidney disease, refractory hypertension, pulmonary edema, or poor urine output.[25]Etymology[edit]The Greek noun ἐκλαμψία, eklampsía, denotes a \"light burst\"; metaphorically, in this context, \"sudden occurrence.\" The New Latin term first appeared in Johannes Varandaeus’ 1620 treatise on gynaecology Tractatus de affectibus Renum et Vesicae.[58] The term toxemia of pregnancy is no longer recommended: placental toxins are not the cause of eclampsia occurrences, as previously believed.[59]Popular culture[edit]In Downton Abbey, a historical drama television series, the character Lady Sybil dies (in series 3, episode 5) of eclampsia shortly after child birth.[60]In Call the Midwife, a medical drama television series set in London in the 1950s and 1960s, the character (in series 1, episode 4) named Margaret Jones is struck with pre-eclampsia, ultimately proceeding from a comatose condition to death.The term \"toxemia\" was also used for the condition, in the dialogue.[61]In House M.D., a medical drama television series set in the U.S., Dr. Cuddy, the hospital director, adopts a baby whose teenage mother dies from eclampsia and had no other parental figures available.[61]References[edit]^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}\"Chapter 40: Hypertensive Disorders\".

The condition most often occurs in premature newborns, but it may also occur in term or near-term babies. Signs and symptoms may include abdominal distension, bloody stools, vomiting bile-stained fluid, and pneumatosis intestinalis (gas in the bowel wall) identified on abdominal x-ray. Affected infants occasionally have temperature instability, lethargy, or other findings of sepsis. The exact cause of NEC is unknown. Treatment involves stopping feedings, passing a small tube into the stomach to relieve gas, and giving intravenous fluids and antibiotics. Surgery may be needed if there is perforated or necrotic (dead) bowel tissue. About 60-80% of affected newborns survive the condition.'},\n",

defect in which nerves are missing from parts of the intestine.[1][3] The most prominent symptom is constipation.[1] Other symptoms may include vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea and slow growth.[1] Symptoms usually become apparent in the first two months of life.[1] Complications may include enterocolitis, megacolon, bowel obstruction and intestinal perforation.[1][2]The disorder may occur by itself or in association with other genetic disorders such as Down syndrome or Waardenburg syndrome.[1][2] About half of isolated cases are linked to a specific genetic mutation, and about 20% occur within families.[1] Some of these occur in an autosomal dominant manner.[1] The cause of the remaining cases is unclear.[1] If otherwise normal parents have one child with the condition, the next child has a 4% risk of being affected.[2] The condition is divided into two main types, short-segment and long-segment, depending on how much of the bowel is affected.[1] Rarely, the small bowel may be affected, as well.[2] Diagnosis is based on symptoms and confirmed by biopsy.[3]Treatment is generally by surgery to remove the affected section of bowel.[2] The surgical procedure most often carried out is known as a \"pull through\".[3] Occasionally, an intestinal transplantation may be recommended.[2] Hirschsprung\\'s disease occurs in about one in 5,000 of newborns.[1] Males are more often affected than females.[1] The condition is believed to have first been described in 1691 by Dutch anatomist Frederik Ruysch[4] and is named after Danish physician Harald Hirschsprung following his description in 1888.[5][6]Contents1 Signs and symptoms1.1 Associated syndromes2 Cause2.1 Genetics2.2 RET proto-oncogene2.3 Other genes3 Pathophysiology4 Diagnosis5 Treatment5.1 Colostomy5.2 Other procedures6 Epidemiology7 History8 See also9 References10 External linksSigns and symptoms[edit]Typically, Hirschsprung disease is diagnosed shortly after birth, although it may develop well into adulthood,because of the presence of megacolon, or because the baby fails to pass the first stool (meconium)[7] within 48 hours of delivery.Normally, 90% of babies pass their first meconium within 24 hours, and 99% within 48 hours.[8] Other symptoms include green or brown vomit, explosive stools after a doctor inserts a finger into the rectum, swelling of the abdomen, excessive gas, and bloody diarrhea.[citation needed]Some cases are diagnosed later, into childhood, but usually before age 10.[7] The child may experience fecal retention, constipation, or abdominal distention.[7]Associated syndromes[edit]Hirschsprung\\'s disease can also present as part of multi system disorders, such as:[9]Bardet–Biedl syndromeCartilage–hair hypoplasia[10]Congenital central hypoventilation

(Gem-associated protein 2)14q13-q21—191315NTRK11q23.1—605802ZEB22q22.3Several genes and specific regions on chromosomes (loci) have been shown or suggested to be associated with Hirschsprung\\'s disease:The RET proto-oncogene accounts for the highest proportion of both familial and sporadic cases, with a wide range of mutations scattered along its entire coding region.[16] A proto-oncogenecan cause cancer if it is mutated or overexpressed.[17]RET proto-oncogene[edit]RET is a gene that codes for proteins that assist cells of the neural crest in their movement through the digestive tract during the development of the embryo.Those neural crest cells eventually form bundles of nerve cells called ganglions. EDNRB codes for proteins that connect these nerve cells to the digestive tract. Thus, mutations in these two genes could directly lead to the absence of certain nerve fibers in the colon. Research suggests that several genes are associated with Hirschsprung\\'s disease.[18] Also, new research suggests that mutations in genomic sequences involved in regulating EDNRB have a bigger impact on Hirschsprung\\'s disease than previously thought.[citation needed]RET can mutate in many ways and is associated with Down syndrome.Since Down syndrome is comorbid in 2% of Hirschsprung\\'s cases, a likelihood exists that RET is involved heavily in both Hirschsprung\\'s disease and Down syndrome.RET is also associated with medullary thyroid cancer and neuroblastoma, which is a type of cancer common in children.Both of these disorders are more common in Hirschsprung\\'s patients than in the general population.One function that RET controls is the travel of the neural crest cells through the intestines in the developing fetus. The earlier the RET mutation occurs in Hirschsprung\\'s disease, the more severe the disorder becomes.[citation needed]Other genes[edit]Common and rare DNA variations in the neuregulin 1 (NRG1) and NRG3 (NRG3) were first shown to be associated with the disease in Chinese patients through a Genome Wide Association Study by the Hong Kong team in 2009 [19] and 2012, respectively[20] Subsequent studies in both Asian and Caucasian patients confirmed the initial findings by the University of Hong Kong. Both rare and common variants in these two genes have been identified in additional Chinese,[21] Thai, Korean, Indonesian, and Spanish patients. These two genes are known to play a role in the formation of the enteric nervous system; thus, they are likely to be involved in the pathology of Hirschsprung\\'s disease, at least in some cases.[citation needed]Another gene associated with this condition is NADPH oxidase, EF-hand calcium binding domain 5 (NOX5).[22] This gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 15 (15q23).[citation needed]Pathophysiology[edit]During normal prenatal development, cells from the neural crest migrate into the large intestine (colon) to form the networks of nerves called the myenteric plexus (Auerbach plexus) (between the smooth muscle layers of the gastrointestinal tract wall) and the submucosal plexus (Meissner plexus) (within the submucosa of the gastrointestinal tract wall). In Hirschsprung disease, the migration is not complete and part of the colon lacks these nerve bodies that regulate the activity of the colon. The affected segment of the colon cannot relax and pass stool through the colon, creating an obstruction.[23]The most accepted theory of the cause of Hirschsprung is a defect in the craniocaudal migration of neuroblasts originating from the neural crest that occurs during the first 12 weeks of gestation.Defects in the differentiation of neuroblasts into ganglion cells and accelerated ganglion cell destruction within the intestine may also contribute to the disorder.[24]This lack of ganglion cells in the myenteric and submucosal plexus is well documented in Hirschsprung\\'s disease.[7] With Hirschsprung\\'s disease, the segment lacking neurons (aganglionic) becomes constricted, causing the normal, proximal section of bowel to become distended with feces. This narrowing of the distal colon and the failure of relaxation in the aganglionic segment are thought to be caused by the lack of neurons containing nitric oxide synthase.[7]The most cited feature is absence of ganglion cells: notably in males, 75% have none in the end of the colon (rectosigmoid) and 8% lack ganglion cells in the entire colon. The enlarged section of the bowel is found proximally, while the narrowed, aganglionic section is found distally, closer to the end of the bowel. The absence of ganglion cells results in a persistent overstimulation of nerves in the affected region, resulting in contraction.[citation needed]The equivalent disease in horses is lethal white syndrome.[25]Diagnosis[edit]A: Plain abdominal radiograph showing a PARTZ at rectosigmoid, arrow. B: Plain abdominal radiograph showing a PARTZ at midsigmoid, arrow. C: Plain abdominal radiograph showing a PARTZ at descending colon, arrow. D: Contrast enema showing a CETZ at rectosigmoid, arrow. E: Contrast enema showing a CETZ at midsigmoid, arrow. F: Contrast enema showing a CETZ at descending colon, arrow.Definitive diagnosis is made by suction biopsy of the distally narrowed segment.[26] A histologic examination of the tissue would show a lack of ganglionic nerve cells. Diagnostic techniques involve anorectal manometry,[27] barium enema, and rectal biopsy.The suction rectal biopsy is considered the current international gold standard in the diagnosis of Hirschsprung\\'s disease.[28]Radiologic findings may also assist with diagnosis.[29] Cineanography (fluoroscopy of contrast medium passing anorectal region) assists in determining the level of the affected intestines.[citation needed]Treatment[edit]Treatment of Hirschsprung\\'s disease consists of surgical removal (resection) of the abnormal section of the colon, followed by reanastomosis.[citation needed]Colostomy[edit]The first stage of treatment used to be a reversible colostomy.In this approach, the healthy end of the large intestine is cut and attached to an opening created on the front of the abdomen. The contents of the bowel are discharged through the hole in the abdomen and into a bag.Later, when the patient\\'s weight, age, and condition are right, the \"new\" functional end of the bowel is connected with the anus. The first surgical treatment involving surgical resection followed by reanastomosis without a colostomy occurred as early as 1933 by Doctor Baird in Birmingham on a one-year-old boy.[citation needed]Other procedures[edit]The Swedish-American surgeon, Orvar Swenson (1909–2012), who discovered the cause of Hirschsprung\\'s, first performed its surgical treatment, the pull-through surgery, in 1948.[30] The pull-through procedure repairs the colon by connecting the functioning portion of the bowel to the anus. The pull-through procedure is the typical method for treating Hirschsprung\\'s in younger patients. Swenson devised the original procedure, and the pull-through surgery has been modified many times.[31]\\'Currently,several different surgical approaches are used, which include the Swenson, Soave, Duhamel, and Boley procedures.[31] The Swenson procedure leaves a small portion of the diseased bowel. The Soave procedure, named after the Italian pediatric surgeon, Franco Soave (1917–1984), leaves the outer wall of the colon unaltered. The Boley procedure, pioneered by the American surgeon, Scott Boley (b. 1941), is a small modification of the Soave procedure, so the term \"Soave-Boley\" procedure is sometimes used.[32][33]The Duhamel procedure, named for the French pediatric surgeon, Bernard Duhamel (1917–1996), uses a surgical stapler to connect the good and bad bowel.[citation needed]For the 15% of children who do not obtain full bowel control, other treatments are available. Constipation may be remedied by laxatives or a high-fiber diet. In those patients, serious dehydration can play a major factor in their lifestyles. A lack of bowel control may be addressed by an ileostomy – similar to a colostomy, but uses the end of the small intestine rather than the colon. The Malone antegrade colonic enema (ACE) is also an option.[34] In a Malone ACE, a tube goes through the abdominal wall to the appendix, or if available, to the colon. The bowel is then flushed daily.[35] Children as young as 6 years of age may administer this daily flush on their own.[citation needed]If the affected portion of the lower intestine is restricted to the lower portion of the rectum, other surgical procedures may be performed, such as a posterior rectal myectomy. The prognosis is good in 70% of cases. Chronic postoperative constipation is present in 7 to 8% of the operated cases. Postoperative enterocolitis, a severe manifestation, is present in the 10–20% of operated patients.[citation needed]Epidemiology[edit]According to a 1984 study conducted in Maryland, Hirschsprung\\'s disease appears in 18.6 per 100,000 live births.[36]In Japan, it occurs at a similar rate of about one in 5,000 births (20 per 100,000).[37] It is more common in male than female (4.32:1) and in white rather than nonwhite.[38]Nine percent of the Hirschsprung cases were also diagnosed as having Down syndrome.[36] Most cases are diagnosed before the patient is 10 years of age.[7]History[edit]The first report of Hirschsprung\\'s disease dates to 1691,[39] when it was described by Dutch anatomist Frederik Ruysch.[40] However, the disease is named after Harald Hirschsprung, the Danish physician who first described two infants who died of this disorder in 1888.[5][6]Hirschsprung\\'s disease is a congenital disorder of the colon in which certain nerve cells, known as ganglion cells, are absent, causing chronic constipation.[41] In patients with Hirschsprung disease, both myenteric and submucosal plexuses are absent.[42] A barium enema is the mainstay of diagnosis of Hirschsprung\\'s, though a rectal biopsy showing the lack of ganglion cells is the only certain method of diagnosis.[citation needed]The first publication on an important genetic discovery of the disease was from Martucciello Giuseppe et al. in 1992. The authors described a case of a patient with total colonic aganglionosis associated with a 46, XX, del 10 (q11.21 q21.2) karyotype.[43] The major gene of Hirschsprung disease was identified in this chromosomal 10 region, it was the RET proto-oncogene.[44]The usual treatment is \"pull-through\" surgery where the portion of the colon that does have nerve cells is pulled through and sewn over the part that lacks nerve cells.[45] For a long time, Hirschsprung\\'s was considered a multifactorial disorder, where a combination of nature and nurture was considered to be the cause. However, in August 1993, two articles by independent groups in Nature Genetics said that Hirschsprung\\'s disease could be mapped to a stretch of chromosome 10.[46][47]This research also suggested that a single gene was responsible for the disorder. However, the researchers were unable to isolate it.[citation needed]See also[edit]AchalasiaIleus, failure of peristaltic muscle activity in the gutIntestinal neuronal dysplasiaReferences[edit]^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}\"Hirschsprung disease\".

       "   'text': \"A number sign (#) is used with this entry because of evidence that long QT syndrome-14 (LQT14) is caused by heterozygous mutation in the CALM1 gene (114180) on chromosome 14q32.For a general phenotypic description and discussion of genetic heterogeneity of long QT syndrome, see LQT1 (192500).Clinical FeaturesCrotti et al. (2013) reported an Italian girl who underwent cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation (VF) at age 6 months. Electrocardiogram (ECG) after defibrillation showed a markedly prolonged QTc interval (630 ms), frequent episodes of T-wave alternans, and intermittent 2:1 atrioventricular block. Echocardiogram showed normal cardiac anatomy and contractile function. An internal cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) was placed, and multiple episodes of VF were terminated by the ICD in the following months. Despite treatment with various medications as well as left-cardiac sympathetic denervation at age 1 year, the patient had 16 episodes of VF during the first 2 years of life: these were mostly induced by adrenergic stimulation, and either began abruptly or were preceded by a brief episode of torsade de pointes that was not pause-dependent. Her parents were asymptomatic with normal ECGs, and there was no history of sudden death in the family.Marsman et al. (2014) studied a Moroccan family with 5 sibs in which the proband experienced cardiac arrest at age 16 years while romping with a classmate at school; an initial recorded rhythm of VF was converted to a sinus rhythm after 2 defibrillatory shocks. Evaluation revealed no structural or functional cardiac abnormalities, ECG showed a normal QTc interval at rest, and flecainide provocation did not uncover a Brugada ECG pattern. On exercise testing, however, mild prolongation of the QTc interval was revealed (459 ms), which was maximal during early recovery (464 ms). An ICD was placed, and in 12 years of follow-up, the proband did not report any syncopal episodes, nor did the ICD record any events involving ventricular tachycardia. Just 7 months following the index event of the proband, his younger sister died suddenly at age 10 years. The family history also included a sister who had died suddenly at age 9 years. Another sister collapsed on the playground at age 10 years and was successfully resuscitated from VF; during the 8-year period following ICD implantation, she experienced 3 episodes of VF that were terminated by ICD shocks. Exercise testing revealed prolongation of the QTc interval in both early and late recovery (474 and 464 ms, respectively). The youngest sister in the family was asymptomatic but also demonstrated prolonged QTc interval on exercise testing. She underwent implantation of an ICD at 7 years of age, and the device did not discharge in 3 years of follow-up. Both parents were asymptomatic with normal ECGs at rest; however, the mother had prolonged QTc intervals (476 ms) at high heart rates. Marsman et al. (2014) stated that although none of the family members met the diagnostic criteria for long QT syndrome, ECG recordings were not available for a large number of mutation carriers in the family, and it was thus 'difficult to rule out LQTS with certainty.'Molecular GeneticsIn an Italian girl with markedly prolonged QTc intervals and multiple episodes of ventricular fibrillation, who was negative for mutation in the 5 genes most frequently associated with long QT syndrome, Crotti et al. (2013) performed exome sequencing and identified a heterozygous de novo missense mutation in the CALM1 gene (D130G; 114180.0003). Analysis of CALM1 in 82 additional patients with LQTS who had no mutations in known LQTS genes revealed a 3-year-old Greek boy who also carried the D130G mutation, as well as a 14-year-old Italian boy with a phe142-to-leu mutation in CALM1 (F142L; 114180.0004). Neither mutation was found in 1,800 white European controls or in public databases, and functional analysis demonstrated a several-fold reduction in calcium-binding affinity for both variants compared to wildtype calmodulin.In a Moroccan family with mild prolongation of the QTc interval in the recovery phase after exercise as well as onset of ventricular fibrillation within the first 2 decades of life, Marsman et al. (2014) performed whole-exome sequencing and identified a heterozygous mutation in the CALM1 gene (F90L; 114180.0005) that segregated with disease in the family. The mutation was not found in 500 Moroccan controls, and the proband was negative for mutation in 14 genes known to be involved in primary arrhythmia syndromes and arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy.INHERITANCE- Autosomal dominantCARDIOVASCULARHeart- Recurrent episodes of ventricular fibrillation- Ventricular tachycardia, nonsustained (in some patients)- Syncopal episodes (in some patients)- Cardiac arrest (in some patients)- Sudden death (in some patients)- Prolonged QTc interval on electrocardiogram (ECG)- T-wave alternans on ECG (in some patients)- Atrioventricular block, 2:1, on ECG (in some patients)- Torsade de pointes on ECG (in some patients)MISCELLANEOUS- Some patients have onset at birth or in early infancy, whereas other have onset in late childhood or adolescence- Some patients experience neurologic sequelae (seizures or developmental delay) after multiple episodes of cardiac arrest- In some patients, QTc interval is prolonged only during exercise testingMOLECULAR BASIS- Caused by mutation in the calmodulin-1 gene (CALM1,114180.0003)▲Close\"},\n",

When at rest, that is not cued by anything in the environment, mothers with PPD have less activity in the left frontal lobe and increased activity in the right frontal lobe when compared with healthy controls. They also have decreased connectivity between vital brain structures including the anterior cingulate cortex, dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus. These areas are important for empathy, memory, and emotion regulation and may explain depressive symptoms as well as decreased motivation toward caregiving. Brain activation differences between depressed and nondepressed mothers is even more pronounced when stimulated by infant and non-infant emotional cues. Depressed mothers show greater neural activity in the right amygdala toward non-infant emotional cues as well as reduced connectivity between the amygdala and right insular cortex - a pattern consistently found in those with depression and anxiety. Recent findings have also identified blunted activity in anterior cingulate cortex, striatum, orbitofrontal cortex, and insula in mothers with PPD when viewing images of their own infants.[18]More robust studies on neural activation regarding PPD have been conducted with rodents than humans and has allowed for greater isolation of specific brain regions, neurotransmitters, hormones, and steroids.[18][19]Onset and duration[edit]Postpartum depression onset usually begins between two weeks to a month after delivery.[20] A study done at an inner-city mental health clinic has shown that 50% of postpartum depressive episodes there began prior to delivery.[21] Therefore, in the DSM-5 postpartum depression is diagnosed under \"depressive disorder with peripartum onset\", in which \"peripartum onset\" is defined as anytime either during pregnancy or within the four weeks following delivery. PPD may last several months or even a year.[22] Postpartum depression can also occur in women who have suffered a miscarriage.[23]For fathers, several studies show that men experience the highest levels of postpartum depression between 3–6 months postpartum.[24]Parent-infant relationship[edit]Postpartum depression can interfere with normal maternal-infant bonding and adversely affect acute and longterm child development. Postpartum depression may lead mothers to be inconsistent with childcare.[25] These childcare inconsistencies may include feeding routines, sleep routines, and health maintenance.[25]In rare cases, or about 1 to 2 per 1,000, the postpartum depression appears as postpartum psychosis.[11] In these, or among women with a history of previous psychiatric hospital admissions,[26] infanticide may occur. In the United States, postpartum depression is one of the leading causes of annual reported infanticide incidence rate of about 8 per 100,000 births.[2]According to research published in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, children can suffer the effects of Postpartum Depression. If a mother experiences Postpartum Depression that goes untreated, it can have adverse effects on her children. When a child is in infancy, these problems can include unusual amounts of crying (colic) and not having normal sleeping patterns. These problems can have a cyclical effect, meaning that they can further agitate the mothers Postpartum Depression and can even lead to the mother further developing Postpartum Depression. These cyclical effects can affect the way the mother maintains her relationship with her child. These can include the stopping of breastfeeding, as well as negative emotions such as withdrawal, disengagement, and even hostility. If a mother develops a hostile relationship, it can lead to extreme outcomes such as infanticide.As the child grows older, Postpartum Depression can lead to the child experiencing irregularities in cognitive processes, behaviors, and emotions. In addition to these abnormalities, children who grew up around Postpartum Depression also are susceptible to developing violent tendencies.[27]Causes[edit]The cause of PPD is unknown. Hormonal and physical changes, personal and family history of depression, and the stress of caring for a new baby all may contribute to the development of postpartum depression.[28][29]Evidence suggests that hormonal changes may play a role.[30] Understanding the neuroendocrinology characteristic of PPD has proven to be particularly challenging given the erratic changes to the brain and biological systems during pregnancy and postpartum. A review of exploratory studies in PPD have observed that women with PPD, have more dramatic changes in HPA axis activity, however directionality of specific hormone increases or decreases remain mixed.[31] Hormones which have been studied include estrogen, progesterone, thyroid hormone, testosterone, corticotropin releasing hormone, endorphins, and cortisol.[6] Estrogen and progesterone levels drop back to pre-pregnancy levels within 24 hours of giving birth, and that sudden change may cause it.[32] Aberrant steroid hormone–dependent regulation of neuronal calcium influx via extracellular matrix proteins and membrane receptors involved in responding to the cell’s microenvironment might be important in conferring biological risk.[33] The use of synthetic oxytocin, a birth-inducing drug, has been linked to increased rates of postpartum depression and anxiety.[34]Fathers, who are not undergoing profound hormonal changes, can also have postpartum depression.[35] The cause may be distinct in males.Profound lifestyle changes that are brought about by caring for the infant are also frequently hypothesized to cause PPD. However, little evidence supports this hypothesis. Mothers who have had several previous children without suffering PPD can nonetheless suffer it with their latest child.[36] Despite the biological and psychosocial changes that may accompany pregnancy and the postpartum period, most women are not diagnosed with PPD.[37][38] Many mothers are unable to get the rest they need to fully recover from giving birth. Sleep deprivation can lead to physical discomfort and exhaustion, which can contribute to the symptoms of postpartum depression.[39]Risk factors[edit]While the causes of PPD are not understood, a number of factors have been suggested to increase the risk:Prenatal depression or anxiety[40]A personal or family history of depression[41]Moderate to severe premenstrual symptoms[42]Stressful life events experienced during pregnancy[43][44]Postpartum blues[40]Birth-related psychological traumaBirth-related physical traumaHistory of sexual abuse[45][46]Childhood trauma[45][46][47]Previous stillbirth or miscarriage[42]Formula-feeding rather than breast-feeding[41]Cigarette smoking[41]Low self-esteem[40]Childcare or life stress[40]Low social support[40]Poor marital relationship or single marital status[40]Low socioeconomic status[40][48]A lack of strong emotional support from spouse, partner, family, or friends[39]Infant temperament problems/colic[40]Unplanned/unwanted pregnancy[40]Low vitamin D levels[49][50]Breastfeeding difficulties[51]Administration of labor-inducing medication synthetic oxytocin[34]Of these risk factors a history of depression, and cigarette smoking have been shown to have additive effects.[41] Some studies have found a link with low levels of DHA in the mother.[52]Chronic illnesses caused by neuroendocrine irregularities including irritable bowl syndrome and fibromyalgiatypically put individuals at risk for further health complications. However, it has been found that these diseases do not increase risk for postpartum depression.[53] These above factors are known to correlate with PPD. This correlation does not mean these factors are causal. Rather, they might both be caused by some third factor. Contrastingly, some factors almost certainly attribute to the cause of postpartum depression, such as lack of social support.[54] The relationship between breastfeeding and PPD is not clear.[55]Women with fewer resources indicate a higher level of postpartum depression and stress than those women with more resources, such as financial. Rates of PPD have been shown to decrease as income increases.[56]Women with fewer resources may be more likely to have an unintended or unwanted pregnancy, increasing risk of PPD. Women with fewer resources may also include single mothers of low income. Single mothers of low income may have more limited access to resources while transitioning into motherhood.Studies have also shown a correlation between a mother\\'s race and postpartum depression. African American mothers have been shown to have the highest risk of PPD at 25%, while Asian mothers had the lowest at 11.5%, after controlling for social factors such as age, income, education, marital status, and baby\\'s health. The PPD rates for First Nations, Caucasian and Hispanic women fell in between.[56]Migration away from a cultural community of support can be a factor in PPD. Traditional cultures around the world prioritize organized support during postpartum care to ensure the mother\\'s mental and physical health, wellbeing, and recovery.[8]One of the strongest predictors of paternal PPD is having a partner who has PPD, with fathers developing PPD 50% of the time when their female partner has PPD.[57]Sexual orientation[58] has also been studied as a risk factor for PPD. In a 2007 study conducted by Ross and colleagues, lesbian and bisexual mothers were tested for PPD and then compared with a heterosexual sample group. It was found that lesbian and bisexual biological mothers had significantly higher Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale scores than did the heterosexual women in the sample.[59] These higher rates of PPD in lesbian/bisexual mothers may reflect less social support, particularly from their families of origin and additional stress due to homophobic discrimination in society.[60]A correlation between postpartum thyroiditis and postpartum depression has been proposed but remains controversial. There may also be a link between postpartum depression and anti-thyroid antibodies.[61]Violence[edit]A meta-analysis reviewing research on the association of violence and postpartum depression showed that violence against women increases the incidence of postpartum depression.[62] About one-third of women throughout the world will experience physical or sexual violence at some point in their lives.[63] Violence against women occurs in conflict, post-conflict, and non-conflict areas.[63] It is important to note that the research reviewed only looked at violence experienced by women from male perpetrators, but did not consider violence inflicted on men or women by women. Further, violence against women was defined as \"any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual, or psychological harm or suffering to women\".[62] Psychological and cultural factors associated with increased incidence of postpartum depression include family history of depression, stressful life events during early puberty or pregnancy, anxiety or depression during pregnancy, and low social support.[59][62] Violence against women is a chronic stressor, so depression may occur when someone is no longer able to respond to the violence.[62]Diagnosis[edit]Criteria[edit]Postpartum depression in the DSM-5 is known as \"depressive disorder with peripartum onset\". Peripartum onset is defined as starting anytime during pregnancy or within the four weeks following delivery. There is no longer a distinction made between depressive episodes that occur during pregnancy or those that occur after delivery.[64] Nevertheless, the majority of experts continue to diagnose postpartum depression as depression with onset anytime within the first year after delivery.[42]The criteria required for the diagnosis of postpartum depression are the same as those required to make a diagnosis of non-childbirth related major depression or minor depression. The criteria include at least five of the following nine symptoms, within a two-week period:[64]Feelings of sadness, emptiness, or hopelessness, nearly every day, for most of the day or the observation of a depressed mood made by othersLoss of interest or pleasure in activitiesWeight loss or decreased appetiteChanges in sleep patternsFeelings of restlessnessLoss of energyFeelings of worthlessness or guiltLoss of concentration or increased indecisivenessRecurrent thoughts of death, with or without plans of suicideDifferential diagnosis[edit]Postpartum blues[edit]Main article: Postpartum bluesPostpartum blues, commonly known as \"baby blues,\" is a transient postpartum mood disorder characterized by milder depressive symptoms than postpartum depression. This type of depression can occur in up to 80% of all mothers following delivery.[65] Symptoms typically resolve within two weeks. Symptoms lasting longer than two weeks are a sign of a more serious type of depression.[66] Women who experience \"baby blues\" may have a higher risk of experiencing a more serious episode of depression later on.[67]Psychosis[edit]Postpartum psychosis is not a formal diagnosis, but is widely used to describe a psychiatric emergency that appears to occur in about 1 in a 1000 pregnancies, in which symptoms of high mood and racing thoughts (mania), depression, severe confusion, loss of inhibition, paranoia, hallucinations and delusions begin suddenly in the first two weeks after delivery; the symptoms vary and can change quickly.[68]It is different from postpartum depression and from maternity blues.[69]It may be a form of bipolar disorder.[70]It is important not to confuse psychosis with other symptoms that may occur after delivery, such as delirium. Delirium typically includes a loss of awareness or inability to pay attention.[67]About half of women who experience postpartum psychosis have no risk factors; but a prior history of mental illness, especially bipolar disorder, a history of prior episodes of postpartum psychosis, or a family history put some at a higher risk.[68]Postpartum psychosis often requires hospitalization, where treatment is antipsychotic medications, mood stabilizers, and in cases of strong risk for suicide, electroconvulsive therapy.[68]The most severe symptoms last from 2 to 12 weeks, and recovery takes 6 months to a year.[68] Women who have been hospitalized for a psychiatric condition immediately after delivery are at a much higher risk of suicide during the first year after delivery.[71]Screening[edit]In the US, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists suggests healthcare providers consider depression screening for perinatal women.[72] Additionally, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends pediatricians screen mothers for PPD at 1-month, 2-month and 4-month visits.[73] However, many providers do not consistently provide screening and appropriate follow-up.[72][74] For example, in Canada, Alberta is the only province with universal PPD screening. This screening is carried out by Public Health nurses with the baby\\'s immunization schedule.The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, a standardized self-reported questionnaire, may be used to identify women who have postpartum depression.[75] If the new mother scores 13 or more, she likely has PPD and further assessment should follow.[75]Healthcare providers may take a blood sample to test if another disorder is contributing to depression during the screening.[76]Prevention[edit]A 2013 Cochrane review found evidence that psychosocial or psychological intervention after childbirth helped reduce the risk of postnatal depression.[77][78] These interventions included home visits, telephone-based peer support, and interpersonal psychotherapy.[77] Support is an important aspect of prevention, as depressed mothers commonly state that their feelings of depression were brought on by \"lack of support\" and \"feeling isolated.\"[79]Across different cultures, traditional rituals for postpartum care may be preventative for PPD, but are more effective when the support is welcomed by the mother.[80]In couples, emotional closeness and global support by the partner protect against both perinatal depression and anxiety. Further factors such as communication between the couple and relationship satisfaction have a protective effect against anxiety alone.[81]In those who are at risk counselling is recommended.[82] In 2018, 24% of areas in the UK have no access to perinatal mental health specialist services.[83]Preventative treatment with antidepressants may be considered for those who have had PPD previously. However, as of 2017, the evidence supporting such use is weak.[84][85]Treatments[edit]Treatment for mild to moderate PPD includes psychological interventions or antidepressants. Women with moderate to severe PPD would likely experience a greater benefit with a combination of psychological and medical interventions.[86] Light aerobic exercise has been found to be useful for mild and moderate cases.[87][88]Therapy[edit]Both individual social and psychological interventions appear equally effective in the treatment of PPD.[89] Social interventions include individual counseling and peer support, while psychological interventions include cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal therapy (IPT).[90] Other forms of therapy, such as group therapy, home visits, counseling, and ensuring greater sleep for the mother may also have a benefit.[13][5]Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) has shown promising results with lower negative parenting behavior scores and lower rates of anxiety, stress, and depression. iCBT may be beneficial for mothers who have limitations in accessing in person CBT. However, the long term benefits have not been determined.[91]Medication[edit]A 2010 review found few studies of medications for treating PPD noting small sample sizes and generally weak evidence.[90] Some evidence suggests that mothers with PPD will respond similarly to people with major depressive disorder.[90] There is evidence which suggests that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are effective treatment for PPD.[92] The first-line anti-depressant medication of choice is sertraline, an SSRI, as very little of the it passes into the breast milk and, as a result, to the child.[5] However, a recent study has found that adding sertraline to psychotherapy does not appear to confer any additional benefit.[93] Therefore, it is not completely clear which antidepressants, if any, are most effective for treatment of PPD, and for whom antidepressants would be a better option than non-pharmacotherapy.[92]Some studies show that hormone therapy may be effective in women with PPD, supported by the idea that the drop in estrogen and progesterone levels post-delivery contribute to depressive symptoms.[90] However, there is some controversy with this form of treatment because estrogen should not be given to people who are at higher risk of blood clots, which include women up to 12 weeks after delivery.[94] Additionally, none of the existing studies included women who were breastfeeding.[90] However, there is some evidence that the use of estradiol patches might help with PPD symptoms.[9]Oxytocin has been shown to be an effective anxiolytic and in some cases antidepressant treatment in men and women. Exogenous oxytocin has only been explored as a PPD treatment with rodents, but results are encouraging for potential application in humans.[31]In 2019, the FDA approved brexanolone, a synthetic analog of the neurosteroid allopregnanolone, for use intravenously in postpartum depression. Allopregnanolone levels drop after giving birth, which may lead to women becoming depressed and anxious.[95] Some trials have demonstrated an effect on PPD within 48 hours from the start of infusion.[96] Other new allopregnanolone analogs under evaluation for use in the treatment of PPD include SAGE-2017 and ganaxolone.[9]Brexanolone has risks that can occur during administration, including excessive sedation and sudden loss of consciousness, and therefore has been approved under the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program.[97] The mother is to enrolled prior to receiving the medication. It is only available to those at certified health care facilities with a health care provider who can continually monitor the patient. The infusion itself is a 60-hour, or 2.5 day, process. People\\'s oxygen levels are to be monitored with a pulse oximeter. Side effects of the medication include dry mouth, sleepiness, somnolence, flushing and loss of consciousness. It is also important to monitor for early signs of suicidal thoughts or behaviors.[97]Breastfeeding[edit]Caution should be exercised when administering antidepressant medications during breastfeeding.[39] Most antidepressants are excreted in breast milk in low quantities which can have adverse effect on babies.[98] Regarding allopregnanolone, very limited data did not indicate a risk for the infant.[99]Other[edit]Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has shown efficacy in women with severe PPD that have either failed multiple trials of medication-based treatment or cannot tolerate the available antidepressants.[86] Tentative evidence supports the use of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS).[100]As of 2013 it is unclear if acupuncture, massage, bright lights, or taking omega-3 fatty acids are useful.[101]Epidemiology[edit]GlobalAmong one of the most common sources of morbidity associated with childbirth, postpartum depression is a major global public health issue.[102] PPD varies in prevalence worldwide.[102] However, research has found that globally postpartum depression is found to be approximately 17.7% prevalence when analyzing data from low- to high-income countries.[102] Across various nations, the prevalence of PPD varied even within nations with similar wealth status.[102] However, between the nations, a predictor for higher postpartum depression rates was found to be wealth disparities within the nations. Those who experience this wealth disparity live at a dramatically different level of material standards than the other’s in their society, even if objectively they are not low income.[102] If a mother has experienced postpartum episodes previously, her risk of experiencing postpartum depression with psychosis is higher than those who have had no previous episodes.[67]United StatesWithin the United States, the prevalence of postpartum depression was lower than the global approximation at 11.5% but varied between states from as low as 8% to as high as 20.1%.[103] The highest prevalence in the US is found among women who are American Indian/Alaska Natives or Asian/Pacific Islanders, possess less than 12 years of education, are unmarried, smoke during pregnancy, experience over two stressful life events, or who’s full term infant is low-birthweight or was admitted to a Newborn Intensive Care Unit. While US prevalence decreased from 2004 to 2012, it did not decrease among American Indian/Alaska Native women or those with full term, low-birthweight infants.[103]Even with the variety of studies, it is difficult to find the exact rate as approximately 60% of US women are not diagnosed and of those diagnosed approximately 50% are not treated for PPD.[103] Cesarean section rates did not affect the rates of PPD. While there is discussion of postpartum depression in father’s, there is no formal diagnosis for postpartum depression in fathers.[104]Issues in Reporting PrevalenceMost studies regarding PPD are done using self-report screenings which are less reliable than clinical interviews. This use of self-report may have results that underreport symptoms and thus postpartum depression rates.[102][103]History[edit]Prior to the 19th century[edit]Western medical science\\'s understanding and construction of postpartum depression has evolved over the centuries. Ideas surrounding women’s moods and states have been around for a long time,[105] typically recorded by men. In 460 B.C., Hippocrates wrote about puerperal fever, agitation, delirium, and mania experienced by women after child birth.[106] Hippocrates\\' ideas still linger in how postpartum depression is seen today.[107]A woman who lived in the 14th century, Margery Kempe, was a Christian mystic.[108] She was a pilgrim known as \"Madwoman\" after having a tough labor and delivery.[108] There was a long physical recovery period during which she started descending into \"madness\" and became suicidal.[108] Based on her descriptions of visions of demons and conversations she wrote about that she had with religious figures like God and the Virgin Mary, historians have identified what Margery Kempe was suffering from as \"postnatal psychosis\" and not postpartum depression.[109][110] This distinction became important to emphasize the difference between postpartum depression and postpartum psychosis. A 16th century physician, Castello Branco, documented a case of postpartum depression without the formal title as a relatively healthy woman who suffered from melancholy after childbirth, remained insane for a month, and recovered with treatment.[107] Although this treatment was not described, experimental treatments began to be implemented for postpartum depression for the centuries that followed.[107] Connections between female reproductive function and mental illness would continue to center around reproductive organs from this time all the way through to modern age, with a slowly evolving discussion around \"female madness\".[105]19th century and after[edit]With the 19th century came a new attitude about the relationship between female mental illness and pregnancy, childbirth, or menstruation.[111] The famous short story, \"The Yellow Wallpaper\", was published by Charlotte Perkins Gilman in this period. In the story, an unnamed woman journals her life when she is treated by her physician husband, John, for hysterical and depressive tendencies after the birth of their baby.[112] Gilman wrote the story to protest societal oppression of women as the result of her own experience as a patient.[113]Also during the 19th century, gynecologists embraced the idea that female reproductive organs, and the natural processes they were involved in, were at fault for \"female insanity.\"[114] Approximately 10% of asylum admissions during this time period are connected to “puerperal insanity,” the named intersection between pregnancy or childbirth and female mental illness.[115] It wasn\\'t until the onset of the twentieth century that the attitude of the scientific community shifted once again: the consensus amongst gynecologists and other medical experts was to turn away from the idea of diseased reproductive organs and instead towards more \"scientific theories\" that encompassed a broadening medical perspective on mental illness.[114]Society and culture[edit]Malay culture holds a belief in Hantu Meroyan; a spirit that resides in the placenta and amniotic fluid.[116] When this spirit is unsatisfied and venting resentment, it causes the mother to experience frequent crying, loss of appetite, and trouble sleeping, known collectively as \"sakit meroyan\". The mother can be cured with the help of a shaman, who performs a séance to force the spirits to leave.[117]Some cultures believe that the symptoms of postpartum depression or similar illnesses can be avoided through protective rituals in the period after birth. These may include offering structures of organized support, hygiene care, diet, rest, infant care, and breastfeeding instruction.[118] The rituals appear to be most effective when the support is welcomed by the mother.[80] Globalization and migration can disconnect women from their traditional communities of maternal support, which can be positive or negative depending on the traditions and on the mother\\'s wishes.Some Chinese women participate in a ritual that is known as \"doing the month\" (confinement) in which they spend the first 30 days after giving birth resting in bed, while the mother or mother-in-law takes care of domestic duties and childcare. In addition, the new mother is not allowed to bathe or shower, wash her hair, clean her teeth, leave the house, or be blown by the wind.[119]In the US, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act included a section focusing on research into postpartum conditions including postpartum depression.[120] Some argue that more resources in the form of policies, programs, and health objectives need to be directed to the care of those with PPD.[121]The stigma of mental health - with or without support from family members and health professionals - often deters women from seeking help for their PPD.[122] When medical help is achieved, some women find the diagnosis helpful and encourage a higher profile for PPD amongst the health professional community.[123]Media[edit]Certain cases of postpartum mental health concerns received attention in the media and brought about dialogue on ways to address and understand more on postpartum mental health. Andrea Yates, a former nurse, became pregnant for the first time in 1976.[124] After giving birth to five children in the coming years, she suffered severe depression and had many depressive episodes. This led to her believing that her children needed to be saved, and that by killing them, she could rescue their eternal souls. She drowned her children one by one over the course of an hour, by holding their heads under water in their family bathtub. When called into trial, she felt that she had saved her children rather than harming them and that this action would contribute to defeating Satan.[125]This was one of the first public and notable cases of postpartum psychosis,[124] which helped create dialogue on women\\'s mental health after childbirth. The court found that Yates was experiencing mental illness concerns, and the trial started the conversation of mental illness in cases of murder and whether or not it would lessen the sentence or not. It also started a dialogue on women going against “maternal instinct” after childbirth and what maternal instinct was truly defined by.[125]Yates\\' case brought wide media attention to the problem of filicide,[126] or the murder of children by their parents. Throughout history, both men and women have perpetrated this act, but study of maternal filicide is more extensive.See also[edit].mw-parser-output .portal{border:solid #aaa 1px;padding:0}.mw-parser-output .portal.tleft{margin:0.5em 1em 0.5em 0}.mw-parser-output .portal.tright{margin:0.5em 0 0.5em 1em}.mw-parser-output .portal>ul{display:table;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0.1em;max-width:175px;background:#f9f9f9;font-size:85%;line-height:110%;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold}.mw-parser-output .portal>ul>li{display:table-row}.mw-parser-output .portal>ul>li>span:first-child{display:table-cell;padding:0.2em;vertical-align:middle;text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .portal>ul>li>span:last-child{display:table-cell;padding:0.2em 0.2em 0.2em 0.3em;vertical-align:middle}Psychiatry portalAntenatal depressionPsychiatric disorders of childbirthSex after pregnancyBreastfeeding and mental healthReferences[edit]^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}\"Postpartum Depression Facts\".

The proband, a 43-year-old woman, had photomyoclonic seizures for 20 years and progressive nerve deafness for 7 years. Her terminal illness began 6 months before death with mild personality change, slowing and slurring of speech, followed by depression, mild diabetes, focal motor seizures affecting either side of the face, emaciation, and confusion. Terminally a coarse horizontal nystagmus and gross ataxia of the trunk and limbs appeared. Serial audiograms from preceding years were consistent with progressive cochlear degeneration. The kidneys at autopsy showed small foci of interstitial chronic inflammation. The renal tubules showed vacuolation and PAS-positive cytoplasmic granules. The brain showed diffuse neuronal degeneration and astrocytosis. Cerebellar granule cells were decreased. Neurons in the dentate and inferior olivary nucleus were decreased. Remaining neurons were ballooned by a PAS-positive, neutral fat-positive material. Other nuclear groups were involved to a lesser degree. A female cousin of the proband had a similar illness with photomyoclonic seizures and progressive nerve deafness in early adult life. Progressive dementia began at age 40 years. Renal tests were normal. Diabetes and photic sensitivity were found in the 2 sibs of the proband, the mother of the proband and her sibs, the maternal grandmother, and scattered other members of the kindred. 'Bright disease' occurred in 3 female relatives. Seven members in the family of the maternal grandfather, all male, succumbed in childhood or adolescence to a rapid neurologic deterioration and dementia.InheritanceHerrmann et al. (1964) suggested that the features of photomyoclonus, cochlear degeneration, diabetes, and nephropathy in this family were inherited together as an autosomal dominant disorder with incomplete penetrance. No instance of male-to-male transmission was observed.GU- NephropathyNeuro- Photomyoclonic seizures-Focal motor seizures-Personality change-Slowed slurred speech-Depression-Confusion-Horizontal nystagmus-AtaxiaInheritance- Autosomal dominantEndocrine- Diabetes mellitusLab- Audiograms consistent with progressive cochlear degeneration-Small foci of interstitial chronic renal inflammation-Vacuolation and PAS-positive cytoplasmic granules in renal tubules-Diffuse neuronal degeneration and astrocytosis of brain-Decreased cerebellar granule cells-Decreased neurons in dentate and inferior olivary nucleiEars- Progressive nerve deafness▲Close\"}]}"
