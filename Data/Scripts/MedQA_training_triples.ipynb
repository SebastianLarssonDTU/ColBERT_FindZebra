      "The arrangement of vessels and nerves that supply the thoracic wall reflects the segmental organization of the wall. Arteries to the wall arise from two sources: the thoracic aorta, which is in the posterior mediastinum, and a pair of vessels, the internal thoracic arteries, which run along the deep aspect of the anterior thoracic wall on either side of the sternum.\n",

      "At first glance, it is difficult to appreciate why the psoas muscle sheath is of greater importance than any other muscle sheath. The psoas muscle and its sheath arise not only from the lumbar vertebrae but also from the intervertebral discs between each vertebra. This disc origin is of critical importance. In certain types of infection, the intervertebral disc is preferentially affected (e.g., tuberculosis and salmonella discitis). As the infection of the disc develops, the infection spreads anteriorly and anterolaterally. In the anterolateral position, the infection passes into the psoas muscle sheath, and spreads within the muscle and sheath, and may appear below the inguinal ligament as a mass.\n",

      "nuclear imaging depends on the selective uptake of various compounds by organs of the body. in thoracic imaging, these compounds are concentrated by one of three mechanisms: blood pool or compartmentalization (e.g., within the heart), physiologic incorporation (e.g., bone or thyroid) and capillary blockage (e.g., lung scan). radioactive isotopes can be administered by either the iv or inhaled routes or both. when injected intravenously, albumin macroaggregates labeled with technetium-99m (99mtc) become lodged in pulmonary capillaries; the distribution of the trapped radioisotope follows the distribution of blood flow. when inhaled, radiolabeled xenon gas can be used to demonstrate the distribution of ventilation. using these techniques, ventilation-perfusion lung scanning was a commonly used technique for the evaluation of pulmonary embolism. pulmonary thromboembolism produces one or more regions of ventilation-perfusion mismatch (i.e., regions in which there is a defect in perfusion that follows the distribution of a vessel and that is not accompanied by a corresponding defect in ventilation [chap. 300]). however, with advances in computed tomography (ct) scanning, scintigraphic imaging has been largely replaced by ct angiography in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism.\n",
