    "# Split the FindZebra corpus\n",
    "The FindZebra corpus contrains a lot of different articles on rare and orphan diseases, each of which has a unique CUI linked to it. The CUI identifies which disease the article is about. The article might potentially be about more than one disease, but only one CUI is connected to it. Even though the whole article is about one disease, some parts of the article might be more relevant than others. In this notebook, every article will be split into several passages to use for both training and retrieval. Every article will be identified with a unique apid (article passage id), and every passage will be linked to the apid of the article it came from.\n",

       " 'Anatomy includes those structures that can be seen grossly (without the aid of magnification) and microscopically (with the aid of magnification). Typically, when used by itself, the term anatomy tends to mean gross or macroscopic anatomy—that is, the study of structures that can be seen without using a microscopic. Microscopic anatomy, also called histology, is the study of cells and tissues using a microscope.',\n",
       " 'Anatomy forms the basis for the practice of medicine. Anatomy leads the physician toward an understanding of a patient’s disease, whether he or she is carrying out a physical examination or using the most advanced imaging techniques. Anatomy is also important for dentists, chiropractors, physical therapists, and all others involved in any aspect of patient treatment that begins with an analysis of clinical signs. The ability to interpret a clinical observation correctly is therefore the endpoint of a sound anatomical understanding.',\n",
       " 'Observation and visualization are the primary techniques a student should use to learn anatomy. Anatomy is much more than just memorization of lists of names. Although the language of anatomy is important, the network of information needed to visualize the position of physical structures in a patient goes far beyond simple memorization. Knowing the names of the various branches of the external carotid artery is not the same as being able to visualize the course of the lingual artery from its origin in the neck to its termination in the tongue. Similarly, understanding the organization of the soft palate, how it is related to the oral and nasal cavities, and how it moves during swallowing is very different from being able to recite the names of its individual muscles and nerves. An understanding of anatomy requires an understanding of the context in which the terminology can be remembered.',\n",
       " 'How can gross anatomy be studied?',\n",
       " 'The term anatomy is derived from the Greek word temnein, meaning “to cut.” Clearly, therefore, the study of anatomy is linked, at its root, to dissection, although dissection of cadavers by students is now augmented, or even in some cases replaced, by viewing prosected (previously dissected) material and plastic models, or using computer teaching modules and other learning aids.',\n",
       " 'Anatomy can be studied following either a regional or a systemic approach.',\n",
       " 'With a regional approach, each region of the body is studied separately and all aspects of that region are studied at the same time. For example, if the thorax is to be studied, all of its structures are examined.',\n",
       " 'This includes the vasculature, the nerves, the bones, the muscles, and all other structures and organs located in the region of the body defined as the thorax. After studying this region, the other regions of the body (i.e., the abdomen, pelvis, lower limb, upper limb, back, head, and neck) are studied in a similar fashion.',\n",
       " 'In contrast, in a systemic approach, each system of the body is studied and followed throughout the entire body. For example, a study of the cardiovascular system looks at the heart and all of the blood vessels in the body. When this is completed, the nervous system (brain, spinal cord, and all the nerves) might be examined in detail. This approach continues for the whole body until every system, including the nervous, skeletal, muscular, gastrointestinal, respiratory, lymphatic, and reproductive systems, has been studied.']"

      " this type of embolism is known as a thromboembolism . complications can arise when a venous thromboembolism (commonly called a vte) lodges in the lung as a pulmonary embolism . supraphysiologic production of vegf from many follicles under the prolonged effect of hcg appears to be the specific key process underlying ohss. thus, while the woman accumulates fluid in the third space, primarily in the form of ascites , she actually becomes hypovolemic and is at risk for respiratory, circulatory (such as arterial thromboembolism since blood is now thicker), and renal problems.\n",
      "\n",
      " [2] [4] a study of more than 200,000 women came to the result that admission to inpatient care during pregnancy was associated with an 18-fold increase in the risk of venous thromboembolism (vte) during the stay, and a 6-fold increase in risk in the four weeks after discharge, compared with pregnant women who did not require hospitalization. [5] the study included women admitted to hospital for one or more days for reasons other than delivery or venous thromboembolism. peripartum cardiomyopathy other names post-partum cardiomyopathy [1] specialty obstetrics , cardiology peripartum cardiomyopathy (ppcm) is a form of dilated cardiomyopathy that is defined as a deterioration in cardiac function presenting typically between the last month of pregnancy and up to six months postpartum . as with other forms of dilated cardiomyopathy, ppcm involves systolic dysfunction of the heart with a decrease of the left ventricular ejection fraction (ef) with associated congestive heart failure and an increased risk of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias , thromboembolism (blockage of a blood vessel by a blood clot), and even sudden cardiac death .\n",
      "\n",
      " thrombotic events occurred more often in years in which the patient had been immobile for more than a week or had had surgery. there was no predisposing event such as surgery or pregnancy in 50% of all first episodes and 65% of recurrences of venous thromboembolism in the heterozygotes. the natural history of mvp varies from benign, with a normal life expectancy, to severe complications associated with the development of significant mitral regurgitation, including congestive heart failure, bacterial endocarditis, atrial fibrillation, thromboembolism, and even sudden death. however, complications are uncommon, affecting less than 3% of individuals with mvp (freed et al., 1999; grau et al., 2007; delling and vasan, 2014).\n",
      "\n",
      " venous thromboembolism most commonly manifests as deep vein thrombosis, which may progress to pulmonary embolism if the clot dislodges and travels to the lung. other manifestations include thromboses of the cerebral or visceral veins and recurrent pregnancy loss (summary by seligsohn and lubetsky, 2001 and varga and kujovich, 2012). thrombotic events occurred more often in years in which the patient had been immobile for more than a week or had had surgery. there was no predisposing event such as surgery or pregnancy in 50% of all first episodes and 65% of recurrences of venous thromboembolism in the heterozygotes.\n",
      "\n",
      " the blockages either result from organised (or hardened) blood clots that usually originate from the deep veins of the lower limbs of the body ( thromboembolism ) and lodge in the pulmonary arterial tree after passing through the right side of the heart. the blockages may also result from scar tissue that forms at the site where the clot has damaged the endothelial lining of the pulmonary arteries, causing permanent fibrous obstruction (blood flow blockage). [18] the rcog advised in early april 2020 that because pregnancy is a hypercoagulable state and that people admitted to hospital with covid-19 are also hypercoagulable, infection with covid-19 could increase the risk of venous thromboembolism and that this risk could be compounded by reduced mobility due to self-isolating. [19] their guidelines thus advise that any pregnant woman admitted to hospital with a covid-19 infection should receive at least 10 days of prophylactic low-molecular-weight heparin after being discharged from the hospital.\n",
