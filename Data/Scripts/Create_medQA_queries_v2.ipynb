       "  A 5-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department by her mother because of multiple episodes of nausea and vomiting that last about 2 hours. During this period, she has had 6–8 episodes of bilious vomiting and abdominal pain. The vomiting was preceded by fatigue. The girl feels well between these episodes. She has missed several days of school and has been hospitalized 2 times during the past 6 months for dehydration due to similar episodes of vomiting and nausea. The patient has lived with her mother since her parents divorced 8 months ago. Her immunizations are up-to-date. She is at the 60th percentile for height and 30th percentile for weight. She appears emaciated. Her temperature is 36.8°C (98.8°F), pulse is 99/min, and blood pressure is 82/52 mm Hg. Examination shows dry mucous membranes. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Abdominal examination shows a soft abdomen with mild diffuse tenderness with no guarding or rebound. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?  \n",
